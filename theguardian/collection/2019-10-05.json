      "bodyText": "Two Australians imprisoned in Iran for flying a drone near a military installation have been freed in an apparent prisoner swap with Tehran. The Australian government denies a quid pro quo, but the release of Jolie King and Mark Firkin from Evin prison came as an Iranian doctoral student, held in a Brisbane jail and wanted for extradition by the US on sanctions-busting allegations, was freed to go home. British-Australian King and Australian citizen Firkin were arrested in early July, reportedly for flying a drone \u2013 to shoot video for their travel blog \u2013 near military installations in Jajrood in Tehran province. They had left their home in Perth, Western Australia, in 2017, documenting their travels on a blog called The Way Overland. Dozens of videos and photographs posted on YouTube and Instagram appear to have been shot using a drone. Drone use with a permit is allowed in Iran but there are strict conditions. People must not fly drones over people or large crowds, over the city of Tehran, or over sensitive areas. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said \u201cvery sensitive\u201d government negotiations had secured the couple\u2019s release. \u201cThe ordeal they have been through is now over, they are being reunited with their loved ones.\u201d Payne said King and Firkin were in good health and good spirits, and had requested privacy. University of Queensland doctoral research student, Reza Dehbashi Kivi, who has been held in a Brisbane jail on sanctions-busting allegations for 13 months, will not be extradited to the US, the Australian government has confirmed. The 38-year-old was arrested in September last year and accused of conspiring to export restricted American-made amplifiers that could be used to detect stealth planes or missiles to Iran. The US sought to have him extradited on six charges, including conspiring to export special amplifiers classified on the US munitions list as \u201cdefence articles\u201d, and of \u201caiding and abetting in the exportation of defence articles from the United States to Iran\u201d. Dehbashi Kivi faced up to 20 years in prison. During a failed application for bail, he told the Brisbane magistrates court he was a PhD student researching the development of a machine to detect skin cancers. Iranian state media agency Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (Irib) has reported Dehbashi Kivi returned to Tehran on Saturday. The attorney general, Christian Porter, would not comment on whether King and Firkin were released in exchange for Dehbashi Kivi but said in a statement that \u201cin all the circumstances of this particular case\u201d Dehbashi Kivi should not be extradited. \u201cMy decision was made in accordance with the requirements of Australian domestic legal processes and is completely consistent with the powers provided to the commonwealth attorney-general under our law,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThe Australian government does not comment on the details behind its consideration of particular cases,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while it is likely that because of Mr Dehbashi Kivi\u2019s nationality some will speculate regarding this matter, consistent with prior practice I do not intend to comment further on the particular details of this case, particularly when any such response from me may diminish our government\u2019s capacity to deal with future matters of this type in Australia\u2019s best interests.\u201d One Australian remains in prison in Tehran. British-Australian academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert was arrested last year on allegations of spying. Cambridge-educated Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer in Islamic studies at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Asia Institute, has reportedly been tried and convicted of espionage and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. She is currently being held in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison, and has endured significant periods of solitary confinement. She has had limited consular access from Australian officials and no contact with her family or friends. Moore-Gilbert\u2019s research has drawn her into areas that could be perceived as sensitive, particularly by an Iranian regime under acute pressure from economic sanctions and deeply suspicious of foreign academics and journalists.

      "bodyText": "Around 15,000 British and Irish racegoers are expected at Longchamp on Sunday and all but a handful will be hoping \u2013 indeed, expecting \u2013 to see Enable round off a glorious career with a historic third success in the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe. Who can blame them? The script to this point seems to demand nothing less. But it may also do its leading player something of a disservice, because the final scene that would confirm Enable\u2019s place among European racing\u2019s all-time greats is a long way from being a foregone conclusion. The 15th race of her career promises to be the most demanding assignment of all. The field is the smallest for a dozen years but there is a depth to the competition that was not there in 2017 \u2013 when Enable had all the allowances as a three-year-old filly \u2013 or 2018, when the year-younger Sea Of Class was seemingly beaten only by her draw. Sea Of Class was the obvious potential improver in last year\u2019s field and she got to within a nose of Enable. This year, though, Enable has three opponents with a similar profile: Sottsass, Japan and the four-year-old Ghaiyyath. All three are fresh, lightly-raced and have very little to find to give her a race. Enable\u2019s class, courage and will to win may see her through once again, but to justify quotes of 4-6, she should be several pounds clear of her field on ratings. Timeform\u2019s figures, though, have her behind Ghaiyyath before factoring in her 3lb mares\u2019 allowance. On the weight-adjusted ratings, Japan and Sottsass are 6lb and 7lb behind Enable, after eight and six races respectively. Both have scope for further improvement, Sottsass in particular, and Jean-Claude Rouget\u2019s runner has also been prepared solely with the Arc in mind. At the available prices, Ghaiyyath must be the value in the market at around 12-1 and potentially bigger still on the PMU. Perhaps it is his disappointing run in the Prix Ganay in April that sticks in some punters\u2019 minds, but that followed close behind his impressive first outing for six months. His first start at 12 furlongs, meanwhile, in last month\u2019s Grosser Preis at Baden, saw him put his exceptional stride to good use on the way to a 14-length success. The draw could have been kinder but the widest stall of 12 is much less of a challenge than 18 of 18, and in terms of his form, rating and scope for improvement, Ghaiyyath\u2019s chance to upset the favourite is as good, if not better, than that of Sottsass or Japan. An each-way bet at 12-1 is surely the way to go.",

The organisation is urging Boris Johnson to show his commitment to mental health by funding a generation of modern psychiatric hospitals to complement his \u00a313bn pledge to build 40 new hospitals for physical illnesses. Last year the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the NHS regulator, voiced its concern that too many mental health wards were \u201cunsafe and provide poor quality care\u201d in \u201cold and unsuitable buildings\u201d. Several trusts have been prosecuted for safety lapses linked to the poor quality of their buildings, in cases that have sometimes involved a patient dying. Ageing facilities, some of which date back to Victorian times, are also hampering patients\u2019 chances of recovering from serious mental illness because they are so cramped and noisy, trusts say. Bradford District Care trust is worried that the adult acute wards at the 1960s-built main facility it runs in the city are potentially unsafe because they have too many \u201cblind spots\u201d where patients with personality disorder or schizophrenia may try to harm themselves. \u201cThe layout of the wards in unhelpful because it means staff don\u2019t always have a clear line of sight of certain patients at all times\u201d, said Liz Romaniak, the trust\u2019s director of finance and estates. \u201cWe have installed CCTV to monitor blind spots, moved the nurses\u2019 stations into the middle of our male and female wards in order to keep a better eye on people, and installed nurse call alarms for patients to use. \u201cBut it\u2019s a constant battle with the environment on the wards, because they don\u2019t provide an ideal calm and therapeutic environment and give us proper lines of sight,\u201d she said. The trust installed the call buttons at patients\u2019 bedsides after CQC inspectors last year highlighted that \u201cstaff could not clearly see all areas of the wards\u201d and asked the trust to put in the alarms \u2013 which are common in more modern units \u2013 to help reduce the risk of self-harm and suicide. The trust wants to gradually replace the wards but does not have the \u00a340m it would cost.

The <em>Observer </em>understands the claims made by each group member carry around five pages of allegations relating to hacking and blagging \u2013 obtaining personal information illegally \u2013 and around 20 pages outlining allegations of concealment and destruction of evidence. The claims cover 1994 to 2011.</p> <p>Byline reports the duke\u2019s claim could see his lawyers seek to establish whether the newspapers intercepted voicemails of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The website claims it will also explore whether, even after Diana\u2019s death in August 1997, private investigators were hired to illegally target her friends and family.</p> <p>Legal experts have suggested the duke would have a problem bringing the claim.

As with the other group claims, the duke alleges evidence was destroyed and concealed and so any limitation defence would fail under Section 32 of the Act if it were shown to have concealed wrongdoing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f62ebef2273d1598a26424654cd675f188d1ff54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f62ebef2273d1598a26424654cd675f188d1ff54/372_163_2586_1551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clive Goodman, royal correspondent of the News of the World, leaves the Old Bailey in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clive Goodman, royal correspondent of News of the World, leaves the Old Bailey in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is far more serious than just phone-hacking because these allegations involve perverting the course of justice, perjury and fraud against senior executives and senior editors,\u201d a source familiar with the claim explained. This would shift the focus away from the actions of individual journalists to the higher echelons of the newspaper organisations.</p> <p>Hitherto the focus of many claims has been on the role of Mulcaire. \u201cMulcaire is just one tiny part of this,\u201d the source said. It is understood that the claim has resulted in the disclosure of thousands of alleged payments to private investigators by Mirror Group and tens of thousands by the <em>Sun </em>and <em>News of the World</em>.</p> <p>There is speculation that close friends and former girlfriends of the duke may have been hacked. \u201cThe royal family might have tight procedures for guarding their privacy, but the duke\u2019s nightclub-going friends may not,\u201d the source suggested.</p> <p>The duke\u2019s lawyers will attempt to obtain evidence of what, if any, personal information was obtained by the newspapers. This could include school reports, financial statements and health records. The sweep could extend back to include his mother.</p> <p>If the case were to go to court, it would raise the prospect of the duke appearing in the witness box.

      "bodyText": "Leading tabloid newspapers concealed or destroyed evidence that they illegally targeted Prince Harry and his circle of friends and advisers over many years, according to allegations contained in his unprecedented legal action against two media groups. He is joining scores of other people in a group claim that alleges editors and executives at Mirror Group Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mirror, and News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of the Sun and the defunct News of the World, mounted an industrial-scale cover-up over more than 20 years. The Byline Investigates website, which first reported the Duke of Sussex was taking legal action, says the group claim is due to be heard next October. The Observer understands the claims made by each group member carry around five pages of allegations relating to hacking and blagging \u2013 obtaining personal information illegally \u2013 and around 20 pages outlining allegations of concealment and destruction of evidence. The claims cover 1994 to 2011. Byline reports the duke\u2019s claim could see his lawyers seek to establish whether the newspapers intercepted voicemails of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The website claims it will also explore whether, even after Diana\u2019s death in August 1997, private investigators were hired to illegally target her friends and family. Legal experts have suggested the duke would have a problem bringing the claim. Under the Limitation Act, there is a six-year window from when a claimant becomes aware of the privacy breach to bring a claim. Clive Goodman, a News of the World journalist, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, were jailed in 2007 for offences including the hacking of voicemails of aides working for the duke and his brother, Prince William. However, it is clear that the duke\u2019s claim extends at least a decade beyond that 2007 case. As with the other group claims, the duke alleges evidence was destroyed and concealed and so any limitation defence would fail under Section 32 of the Act if it were shown to have concealed wrongdoing. \u201cThis is far more serious than just phone-hacking because these allegations involve perverting the course of justice, perjury and fraud against senior executives and senior editors,\u201d a source familiar with the claim explained. This would shift the focus away from the actions of individual journalists to the higher echelons of the newspaper organisations. Hitherto the focus of many claims has been on the role of Mulcaire. \u201cMulcaire is just one tiny part of this,\u201d the source said. It is understood that the claim has resulted in the disclosure of thousands of alleged payments to private investigators by Mirror Group and tens of thousands by the Sun and News of the World. There is speculation that close friends and former girlfriends of the duke may have been hacked. \u201cThe royal family might have tight procedures for guarding their privacy, but the duke\u2019s nightclub-going friends may not,\u201d the source suggested. The duke\u2019s lawyers will attempt to obtain evidence of what, if any, personal information was obtained by the newspapers. This could include school reports, financial statements and health records. The sweep could extend back to include his mother. If the case were to go to court, it would raise the prospect of the duke appearing in the witness box. Many executives and senior editors \u2013 including Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News UK, the parent company of NGN, and Piers Morgan, former editor of the Mirror \u2013 would come under further scrutiny. Both have denied under oath knowing of any wrongdoing on their watch. In 2015, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d NGN had deleted emails to pervert the course of justice. Both News UK and Reach UK, owner of the Mirror, declined to comment. The duke\u2019s claim against the two news groups comes after his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, launched a legal case against the Mail on Sunday. She claims the paper breached her privacy and copyright by publishing a private letter to her father. The paper has said it will vigorously defend the claim.

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City could not compete for silverware and league titles if his side were filled with players coming through from the club\u2019s academy. The City manager defended the conspicuous lack of talent emerging to become regular first-team starters. Players such as Phil Foden have yet to hold down a regular place in the Premier League and despite the opening of the City academy in December 2014 the club still buy in big-name players rather than pushing forward the youngsters they have nurtured themselves. Chelsea, albeit because of a transfer embargo, are now doing the latter with some success. Guardiola said: \u201cThis team needs to win titles and prizes and the process for the young players needs time and the best way is step by step. But the demand from the club [is] not winning the Champions League but being there every time, in all competitions and for that needs the [senior] players we have. \u201cWhen they are talented, they will play. But at the same time, we have to compete every day to fight with the best in England and Europe. For that we need the David Silvas, Kevin De Bruynes, Sergio Ag\u00fceros and Fernandinhos. But if the basis of the team is young, it is not possible.\u201d The homegrown Foden is highly rated by the manager but the 19-year-old has made just three appearances this season, starting only the EFL Cup win at Preston in September, and may not be in the XI for the visit of Wolves on Sunday. Guardiola was asked if the midfielder is content to be patient. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak with him so I don\u2019t know. Hopefully,\u201d he said, before brushing aside concerns that other young players will be put off signing if they see the pathway to first-team football being blocked. Raheem Sterling was signed at 20 and has consistently played under Guardiola. \u201cI don\u2019t see the age. If the player wants to come, they will, if they don\u2019t, they will not. Everyone knows exactly what my opinion of Phil Foden is. He will play a lot this season and the next seasons.\u201d Since John Stones was injured almost three weeks ago, joining Aymeric Laporte on the sidelines, Guardiola has been forced to play Fernandinho, a midfielder, alongside Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi at centre-back, or pair the teenagers Eric Garc\u00eda and Taylor Harwood-Bellis, as he did at Preston, yet City have conceded once in winning their past five games. Guardiola said: \u201cAgainst Everton we were lucky, Ederson saved two or three clear chances. We are not built specifically for [defending] and we have to learn better. But in general I\u2019m so satisfied. Not just this season \u2013 we concede few goals, chances.

Bruce, who played in that classic, will revert to Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s counterattacking, possession-light 3-4-3 formation, with his mind possibly made up during conversations with a certain Scot, starting when Manchester United drew 1-1 with Arsenal. \u201cI always ring Sir Alex for a bit of advice now and again and I\u2019ve spoken to him a couple of times,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cHe\u2019s been terrific. If there\u2019s ever a time you need advice, he\u2019s always there to help. I saw him on Monday night at Old Trafford but you don\u2019t want to know what he said to me.\u201d Bruce is thinking about handing Andy Carroll his first start since the striker rejoined the club, and he hopes for an improved display from Sean Longstaff. Although the midfielder, 22 at the end of this month, remains immensely promising, his progress has been impeded by a combination of the serious knee injury he suffered last spring and persistent summer-time rumours linking him with Manchester United. \u201cSean Longstaff needs to concentrate on his performances, rather than worrying about speculation,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cAll Sean can do now is recover from his bad knee and start playing well again. \u201cHe\u2019s a young lad, he was going to be distracted. But he\u2019s got to learn to just get on with the job in hand and to forget contracts, forget his knee injury, forget Manchester United. It\u2019s all about getting back to playing for us at the level we know he\u2019s capable of.\u201d",

Minutes later the British men\u2019s 4x100m team repeated the trick, breaking the European record to come second behind a stacked US quartet, to bring Britain\u2019s medal haul to five at these world championships.</p> \n<p>Afterwards Asher-Smith praised her teammates, Daryll Neita, Asha Philip and Ashleigh Nelson, for helping her achieve an historic hat-trick \u2013 especially as Philip had to replace Imani-Lara Lansiquot, who aggravated a thigh injury just before the race. \u201cWe all handled the situation fantastically,\u201d said Asher-Smith, after the British team had come home in a season\u2019s best 41.85sec. \u201cIt is a testament to our experience as a squad. We have done how many championships now? We have the experience to switch people around and it was almost a PB with no practice in warm-up areas. This is a team event, and it is testament to our hard work.\u201d</p> \n<p>Neita, meanwhile, lavished compliments on Asher-Smith. \u201cShe knows how proud we are,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s been doing her thing since day one. She\u2019s killing it, she\u2019s smashing it. She\u2019s a G. You are doing bits, darling. You are doing bits.\u201d</p> \n<p>Philip, who ran a superb first leg before passing the baton to Asher-Smith, added: \u201cImani wasn\u2019t feeling 100%. I was ready as a team member. In the relay you have to be ready for any situation. Imani didn\u2019t feel comfortable and stood aside as she didn\u2019t want to put team into jeopardy.\u201d</p> \n<p>If anything the British men\u2019s team of Adam Gemili, Zharnel Hughes, Richard Kilty and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake were even more impressive on the night, setting a European record of 37.36 to take silver behind a US team that ran 37.10 \u2013 the third fastest time in history \u2013 despite Hughes feeling a hamstring niggle just before the race. \u201cIt felt incredible,\u201d said Kilty. \u201cWhat more could we ask? It took the third fastest time in history to beat us. That was the best team America have ever assembled. Zharnel, what a warrior. He went through a pulled hamstring to deliver me that baton. And we\u2019re so proud of each other.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c079dba3faa95058bb37a145298a3d2af574a5f2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c079dba3faa95058bb37a145298a3d2af574a5f2/0_62_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Britain\u2019s Zharnel Hughes (second right) sprints towards the finish line.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain\u2019s Zharnel Hughes (second right) sprints towards the finish line.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ibraheem Al Omari/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It has been quite some transformation for Britain\u2019s men\u2019s squad, who for the best part of a decade were a byword for incompetence and rancour.</p> \n<p>Incredibly, having been disqualified or having messed up in five of six major global finals between the 2008 Olympics and the 2015 world championships, they have won a gold and a silver at the last two global events.</p> \n<p>So what changed?

Even so, her finishing time of 3:55.76 was still her second fastest ever. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said Muir. \u201cI was fifth in 3:55. I tried to cover the moves as best I could. I think I lost a gear or two in the last 100m. But to run 3:55. Especially when I missed so much training. I am speechless but so proud of myself.\u201d No wonder Muir believes that her performance can be a springboard for better things at next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo. \u201cI take a lot of confidence that things can be so disrupted and I can still go out and produce that kind of performance,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully next year I\u2019ll be fighting fit and 100% going into the Olympics. If I can do that \u2013 and 3:55, is me unfit \u2013 I\u2019d love to see what I can do if I\u2019m 100%.\u201d It later emerged that not only had Muir\u2019s coach, Andy Muir, worked minor miracles to get his athlete to Doha in the first place \u2013 but she then had a stomach bug just before flying out. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really bumpy journey,\u201d said Muir. \u201cThe rehab didn\u2019t go as smoothly as we wanted to. We had a couple of setbacks. You lose that conditioning when you come back. I also got a stomach bug a couple of weeks ago that took out half a week. If you add it all up, the injury took a lot out.\u201d Even so, the glass was definitely half full for Muir. Whether those in the sport will feel quite the same after Hassan\u2019s performance remains an open question. 5.02pm 100m hurdles semis (w) 5.15 Long jump final (w) 5.40 1500m final (m) 5.55 javelin final (m) 6.00 10,000m final (m) 6.50 100m hurdles final (w) 7.15 4x400m relay final (w) 7.30 4x400m relay final (m) TV BBC1, BBC2 and Red Button Radio BBC Radio 5 Live",

Hassan wins it in 3.51.95 to earn a Championship record, while Kipyegon and Tsegay take second and third, respectively. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6320b1c14aaf7d3dfdee3c71e7b59bc1d17f526a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6320b1c14aaf7d3dfdee3c71e7b59bc1d17f526a/0_0_3500_2578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Muir could not keep up with eventual winner Sifan Hassan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Muir could not keep up with eventual winner Sifan Hassan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-05T18:10:58.602Z\">at 7.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d98d83e8f084ab841733510\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-05T17:52:26.329Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Laura Muir is up next in the 1500m final. </strong>Can she do it?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d98d7918f08fbb0c17219ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-05T17:49:58.604Z\">6.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Michael Johnson says it\u2019s \u201cshocking\u201d that Martyn Rooney is still in the 4x400m relay team.</strong> And he\u2019s quite right and even Rooney knows it. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d98d6fc8f084ab841733504\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-05T17:46:43.663Z\">6.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Outside the stadium ...</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tariqpanja/status/1180538657054351369\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Stuck in typical Doha gridlock and suggested to taxi driver it might be better if I walked.

      "bodyText": "That concludes the blog for this evening. Sean Ingle\u2019s piece from Doha to follow as will live coverage of the final day of the meet on Sunday. The Team GB 4x100m silver medalist athletes have been talking to BBC TV. Adam Gemili: \u201cWe were always pushing for the gold but the Americans were better than us. We ran a new British record. We tried our best and hopefully it was a good show for the crowd. Leaving with something is great and it puts a spark in us for next year.\u201d Zharnel Hughes: \u201cI think I strained my hamstring maybe. Tonight I came out here and gave it my very best regardless. I pulled it just before I handed over the baton but I knew I had to give it to Richard regardless because I wanted the guys to get a medal. I did my best and the guys came away with a medal. I\u2019m happy, we\u2019re going back home with something around our neck. Richard Kilty: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely incredible. It took an American record, the second fastest time ever to beat us. We ran a new European record. Zharnel is a proper warrior. When I saw him flying down the straight, I heard something happen so I knew I had to slow a bit. We came out here as brothers and we\u2019re buzzing.\u201d Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake: \u201cPhenomenal effort by the guys. I\u2019m proud of the boys. It gives us fuel for the fire for next year. Let\u2019s enjoy the moment right now though.\u201d Yulimar Rojas wins the women\u2019s triple jump for Venezuela with an earlier jump of 15.37, though didn\u2019t manage to break the world record, as she attempted on her final jump. Jamaica\u2019s Shanieka Ricketts took silver with 14.92 and Colombia\u2019s Caterine Ibarguen bronze on 14.73m. It\u2019s a new European record for Great Britain but they just fell a little short in the end. Hughes looks like he has hurt his hamstring in the process. A poor second changeover for Great Britain costs them a little bit of time, as they finish second. USA win it and deservedly so. Adam Gemili, Richard Kilty, Zharnel Hughes and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake ran 37.36 seconds as they failed to defend the title won in London two years ago. The USA\u2019s team of Christian Coleman, Justin Gatlin, Michael Rodgers and Noah Lyles took the title in 37.10secs while Japan were third. Asha Philip explains Imani wasn\u2019t feeling 100% and needed replacing at the last minute. Asher-Smith gets a round of applause for her third medal of the competition. China finished in 1.05.97 after a failed change over forced them to go back and re-do it in order to make sure they finish in order to qualify for the Olympics. Jamaica lead from start to finish to win it in 41.44 with Great Britain second and USA third. A good result for Great Britain after a slightly slow start but they made up for it in the end. The 100m relays are next up, so the BBC are explaining are Great Britain are good at messing it up. Let\u2019s hope it won\u2019t end up like it this time. Weightman says: \u201cI am probably a bit frustrated. For a first global championship, to finish seventh is good, but I am left wanting more and that\u2019s the best way to leave.\u201d McColgan says: \u201cI did my best to make it a hard race for the start, so all those girls have me to thank. I wanted to run 14.40 or thereabouts, so just a couple of seconds off. We both ran PBs today, so that\u2019s all you can ask for.\u201d Weightman finished in seventh in the end, while McColgan was 10th, which both will be reasonably happy with. Both look very tired after it having run personal bests in a very quick race. Obiri hears the bell and starts sprinting for the final 400m. Klosterhalfen keeps pace with her going into the final bend but then Obiri breaks her and takes the win, with Kipkemboi taking second and the German third. Six are left at the front with Obiri stretching it out with Klosterhalfen just behind. The six pretty comfortable at the front but it\u2019s no surprise considering the slowing pace. McColgan moves up to the front quickly but it\u2019s a relatively slow race until Obiri tries to force it up a little bit in the 500m final. The Brit drops back as Obiri looks to dominate at the front. The Kenyan sticks at the front for a long period and looks pretty comfortable in that position. Next up it\u2019s the 5000m women\u2019s final. Eilish McColgan and Laura Weightman are the Great British interests on the track. In the women\u2019s triple jump, Rojas goes well beyond 15m to extend her lead at the top. It\u2019s not a World Record but it\u2019s not far off at 15.37m. More madness in the shot put as Kovacs goes even further with 22.91 to first, before Crouser follows that with 22.90m just sit in joint second with Walsh. They\u2019ve all broken what was the Championship record before tonight. Kovacs is the one to take gold, though. Oh ... Laura Muir says: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, I finished fifth with 3.55. But to run 3.55 when I missed so much training, I am speechless but I am so, so proud of myself. \u201cI am so happy to run 3.55 and no way in the world I would have thought I\u2019d finish fifth.\u201d Muir does seem impressively happy about the whole thing. She also then thanks everyone she\u2019s ever met. What a quick final! So many PBs and national records broken there with little to show for it thanks to Hassan\u2019s speed at the front. The top seven have broken a record in that. Muir gets herself to the back very quickly, just where she wants to be. Realising the danger at the front, Muir kicks a little earlier than expected to move up the field. Hassan leads for the first two lap and is doing it at a decent speed - the second lap was just 62 seconds. Muir gets right up to the front midway through the third lap, ending it in second as the bell rings. Hassan works to get away from Muir and the Brit can\u2019t compete, dropping back to third and needing a lot of effort to stay there. Hassan goes clear and Muir is nowhere to be seen in fifth. Muir just could not compete with the pace. Hassan wins it in 3.51.95 to earn a Championship record, while Kipyegon and Tsegay take second and third, respectively. Laura Muir is up next in the 1500m final. Can she do it? Michael Johnson says it\u2019s \u201cshocking\u201d that Martyn Rooney is still in the 4x400m relay team. And he\u2019s quite right and even Rooney knows it. Outside the stadium ... Not a classic lineup for the second 4x400m heat. Jamaica get the lead, while South Africa, France and Belgium make up the rest of the battle at the end of the second. There\u2019s a scrap for third and fourth is pretty hardcore, it ends with Jamaica, Belgium and Trinidad and Tobago getting the automatic spots, while France\u2019s time in fourth knows out Great Britain. Another goes beyond 22m in the shot put - Romani goes into second with 22.53m. What a start to the competition. Martyn Rooney says: \u201cI let them [the team] down again, it\u2019s a habit that I don\u2019t like, particularly Lee [Thompson] who works full-time and has taken time off to come out here.\u201d Rooney adds it was his fault as he failed to commit to a plan in the final leg. Great Britain\u2019s hopes are hanging by a thread, knowing they could still be the second best loser but it\u2019s going to be tight. The first leg sees Colombia start incredibly well in the outside lane but USA just edge it. Yousif for Great Britain needs to go round everyone to get to the front and hands over Thompson. At the end of the second leg, USA are left in four, which they are not used to. London for USA is not messing about and speeds past the entire field to lead at the end. Rooney takes the baton for Great Britain, sitting on the shoulder of the Japanese athlete but his thinking is confused and he does not attack it. USA win it, Colombia second, Italy third, Botswana fourth and Great Britain fifth. That\u2019s a poor final leg for Rooney. We have the the men\u2019s 4x400m relays next up. Heat one will include Great Britain. In the meantime Tom Walsh produces the the throw of his life in the shot put with 22.90m - a new PB and Championship record. Michael Johnson points out that Jamaica and USA will be battling it out for gold, while Great Britain have a sniff of a medal alongside Ukraine and Poland. Belgium, despite missing out on third in the second heat do qualify for the final thanks to their time. Only six teams in the second 4x400m heat due to Botswana not starting. Italy and Switzerland finish the first leg in very good positions. Williams gets moving well on the second leg for Great Britain to get the team back into it. Felix opens up a great gap at the front for USA at the end of the second leg. The USA continue this with Turner not too far behind when the third leg concludes. USA bring it home with Great Britain behind and the final qualifier is Ukraine .... just about. It\u2019s a photo finish! Great Britain came home with a season best, so they cannot complain with that. Ryan Crouser gets a Championship record in the shot put with 22.36m. Not a bad start in the first round for the American. Salazar is dominating a lot of the chat in Doha. Sean Ingle has the latest ... Abigail Irozuru and Chanice Porter will both be representing Great Britain in the long jump final on Sunday after some fine jumping on Saturday. McGregor gets Jamaica in a good position in the first leg, putting them in a commanding lead with Canada and France also running well. The second leg ends with things looking tight but Jamaica just have the edge still but Canada really making some impressive moves. It looks going into the anchor left that the two four are set with Jamaica and Poland at the front. McPherson moves clear for Jamaica with a 50.1 seconds final leg while Poland and Canada complete the top three to qualify. The athletes are in place for the first heat of the women\u2019s 4x400m relay. Great Britain are in the second heat. Mutaz Essa Barshim has collected his gold medal for winning the high jump and celebrates with his trademark bird impression. The camera is managing to pick out the few spectators in the stadium. Laura Muir is, needless to say, looking to win in Doha. If she does get gold she will be the third British woman to win in Qatar following Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson. \u201cIt would be great to get three from three,\u201d she said in Doha. \u201cThat is not to discount any other athletes. \u201cI know Dina, KJT and myself have been figureheads for this team in the media and I would love to get that medal. \u201cDina has got two and Kat has one and if we get a few more on the table that would be fantastic.\u201d Welcome to another night of action in Doha. We\u2019ll have the relay heats, while Eilish McColgan and Laura Weightman are both in action in the 5000m final. Hopefully there will be someone there to watch it all, too. Laura Muir will also be in the mix for the 1500m final. Great Britain will certainly be hoping by the end of the night they will have added to their three medals in the competition so far. Here\u2019s something to get you in the mood for the Marathon, too.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hard to pick out detail from the grainy footage, but it\u2019s clear from the commentary that something odd has just happened at the 2009 English Schools\u2019 championships. How on earth have Kent managed to storm into the lead in the 4x100m relay? Were there some irregularities in the baton handover? \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any red flags go up yet,\u201d the commentator says, sceptically. For anyone watching 10 years later, the answer is obvious: the replay shows the first Kent runner handing the baton to a 13-year-old Dina Asher-Smith. The footage, uploaded to YouTube by her mother Julie, is probably Asher-Smith\u2019s first TV appearance. She hares down the back straight and gives the baton to her teammate Sophie Ayre, who rounds the final bend in first place. \u201cWe immediately had her on second leg as it\u2019s the longest,\u201d Ayre said. \u201cShe was so easy to work with in a team and we all had fun practising. I was on third leg so she passed me the baton and we always had a really good change.\u201d The 23-year-old ran the same leg for Great Britain\u2019s 4x100m team at the IAAF world championships in Doha on Saturday. They held off the USA to finish second: a silver medal to add to her 200m gold and 100m silver, both new British records, and all accomplished with her trademark beaming smile. World domination beckons. Asher-Smith has a 2:1 in history from King\u2019s College London. Vogue and Elle have feted her, as have Stormzy and Dave, the rapper who won the Mercury prize last month. Last year she and her fellow gold medallist Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who won the heptathlon on Friday, modelled on the catwalk at Paris fashion week. The two women may just be the stars that British athletics needs to nudge people back on to the track. While football, cricket and swimming have all seen falling levels of participation at grassroots, running had seemed to be the one sport that was bucking the trend, with nearly 7 million people running regularly. The growth of parkrun and health drives through programmes such as Couch to 5k have led to more street runners, particularly women. Yet the number of people doing regular track and field events such as sprinting, high jump and javelin has been falling. In November 2016 Sport England\u2019s Active Lives Survey recorded 249,000 people taking part regularly in track and field activities. By November 2018 that figure had fallen to 197,000. Asher-Smith is now focusing on an Olympic gold medal \u2013 or two, maybe even three \u2013 in Tokyo next year and Ayre can imagine how her competitors feel.

The TV journalist was at the Cheltenham literature festival on Saturday to talk about her book Airhead: The Imperfect Art of Making News, which takes readers behind the scenes. She was asked what her one question would be if she had Boris Johnson on Newsnight this week. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure it matters what question you ask Boris Johnson,\u201d she said, to audience laughter. \u201cI think increasingly I really come to appreciate the people, the politicians, the interviewees, of any stripe and size who are able to answer a question.

No deal will never be Europe\u2019s choice. It would be \u2013 and note the conditional tense, because I hope still to find a deal \u2013 it would always be the UK\u2019s choice, not ours. We\u2019re ready for it, we\u2019ve taken measures to protect our citizens and our businesses. But we do not want it.\u201d His comments came as Downing St made clear it would not give any substantial ground and that the onus was on the EU to show flexibility.</p> <p>At a meeting of government advisers on Friday night, Johnson\u2019s closest aide, Dominic Cummings, said if Brussels did not soften its opposition to the UK\u2019s proposals, the UK would be ready to leave with no deal.</p> <p>The signs of deadlock increased after a week in which the Johnson government tabled new proposals under which Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs territory with the rest of the UK on 31 October, but remain in the single market for goods. The Northern Irish assembly would also be given the right to veto the arrangements every four years, even though the power-sharing assembly was dissolved more than two years ago.</p> <p>However, Barnier said that there were serious problems with the plans which threatened the EU single market and did not answer EU concerns on the need for customs checks: \u201cWe are a single market. That\u2019s a complete ecosystem, with common rights, common norms, common standards, common rules, a common legal system. It requires checks at its borders.\u201d</p> <p>Downing St had suggested before the weekend that the prime minister would be touring EU capitals this week to try to make progress towards a deal.</p> <p>But in a firm rebuff, the European Commission made clear there was insufficient basis for more negotiation as the gulf between the two sides remained too wide, and it did not want to give the impression that progress could be made when it could not.</p> <p>Nevertheless, No 10 said that the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, would travel to the Netherlands on Sunday, and that Johnson would continue to \u201chit the phones over the next couple of days\u201d, and remained open to meeting EU leaders if they wanted to see him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b44a526a0cc778424e943223c5d09589dcd9856\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b44a526a0cc778424e943223c5d09589dcd9856/280_443_4106_2465/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Barclay,secretary of state for exiting the European Union.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Barclay, secretary of state for exiting the European Union.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/05/brexit-boris-johnson-plan-eu-nicky-morgan-comment\" title=\"\">Writing in the Observer</a>, the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, a former Remainer, says a deal should be done but that she is now prepared to see a no-deal outcome in order to settle the Brexit issue.</p> <p>Urging MPs to rally behind the Johnson plans, she writes: \u201cI know that some people may have been surprised when I took a role in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet, but what the critics miss is that there is nothing ultimately to be gained for our country or our constituents in any of us remaining stuck in our views from three years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been clear for months that the current Brexit situation simply cannot continue and that an end to this first phase must be found. For that reason, I can support the prime minister\u2019s clear view that we must leave the European Union on 31 October \u2013 either with a deal or without one.\u201d</p> <p>Also in this paper, former prime minister Tony Blair describes Johnson\u2019s proposals as a \u201chotchpotch\u201d that would \u201cundermine the peace so carefully constructed\u201d in Northern Ireland and maintained for more than two decades.</p> <p>Johnson could face further difficulties tomorrow when the Court of Session in Edinburgh rules in a case bought by anti-Brexit campaigners who want to ensure he seeks an extension to the UK\u2019s membership if he has not reached a deal with the EU by 19 October. </p> <p>Rory Stewart, the former Conservative minister and leadership candidate \u2013 who announced last week that he was leaving the party and would stand as an independent for the job of mayor of London \u2013 said that Johnson risks stoking anger by promising Brexiters a no-deal outcome on 31 October that he cannot deliver as he is bound by the Benn Act to seek an extension to avoid the UK leaving with no agreement.</p> <p>\u201cPoliticians often respond by making extreme and extravagant promises that cannot be delivered (\u2018I will leave on 31 October \u2013 do or die),\u201d he said.</p> <p>And he added: \u201cThey then blame their inevitable failure on some mysterious \u2018establishment\u2019, making people even angrier.</p> <p>\u201cIt is this politics that ultimately divides a country \u2013 it pits rich against poor, north against south, London against the rest, people against parliament, Brexit against Remain. It seeks to corral voters into hostile tribes.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said Boris Johnson\u2019s government will have to bear full responsibility for a no-deal Brexit, as more than three years of talks between the UK and Brussels appeared on the brink of collapse last night. In what appeared to be the opening shots in a blame game as both sides sense failure, Barnier said he could not see how a deal could be done unless the British side came forward with revised proposals within days. If it refused to do so \u2013 and there was no deal as a result \u2013 this would be viewed by the EU as the deliberate choice of Boris Johnson\u2019s government. \u201cIf they do not change, I do not believe, on the basis of the mandate I have been given by the EU27, that we can advance,\u201d Barnier said on Saturday at an event in Paris organised by Le Monde. If the UK was still serious about a deal it would return with \u201cdifferent proposals\u201d this week and the EU side would be prepared to talk, he said. But he added: \u201cI want to be extremely clear. No deal will never be Europe\u2019s choice. It would be \u2013 and note the conditional tense, because I hope still to find a deal \u2013 it would always be the UK\u2019s choice, not ours. We\u2019re ready for it, we\u2019ve taken measures to protect our citizens and our businesses. But we do not want it.\u201d His comments came as Downing St made clear it would not give any substantial ground and that the onus was on the EU to show flexibility. At a meeting of government advisers on Friday night, Johnson\u2019s closest aide, Dominic Cummings, said if Brussels did not soften its opposition to the UK\u2019s proposals, the UK would be ready to leave with no deal. The signs of deadlock increased after a week in which the Johnson government tabled new proposals under which Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs territory with the rest of the UK on 31 October, but remain in the single market for goods. The Northern Irish assembly would also be given the right to veto the arrangements every four years, even though the power-sharing assembly was dissolved more than two years ago. However, Barnier said that there were serious problems with the plans which threatened the EU single market and did not answer EU concerns on the need for customs checks: \u201cWe are a single market. That\u2019s a complete ecosystem, with common rights, common norms, common standards, common rules, a common legal system. It requires checks at its borders.\u201d Downing St had suggested before the weekend that the prime minister would be touring EU capitals this week to try to make progress towards a deal. But in a firm rebuff, the European Commission made clear there was insufficient basis for more negotiation as the gulf between the two sides remained too wide, and it did not want to give the impression that progress could be made when it could not. Nevertheless, No 10 said that the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, would travel to the Netherlands on Sunday, and that Johnson would continue to \u201chit the phones over the next couple of days\u201d, and remained open to meeting EU leaders if they wanted to see him. Writing in the Observer, the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, a former Remainer, says a deal should be done but that she is now prepared to see a no-deal outcome in order to settle the Brexit issue. Urging MPs to rally behind the Johnson plans, she writes: \u201cI know that some people may have been surprised when I took a role in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet, but what the critics miss is that there is nothing ultimately to be gained for our country or our constituents in any of us remaining stuck in our views from three years ago. \u201cIt has been clear for months that the current Brexit situation simply cannot continue and that an end to this first phase must be found. For that reason, I can support the prime minister\u2019s clear view that we must leave the European Union on 31 October \u2013 either with a deal or without one.\u201d Also in this paper, former prime minister Tony Blair describes Johnson\u2019s proposals as a \u201chotchpotch\u201d that would \u201cundermine the peace so carefully constructed\u201d in Northern Ireland and maintained for more than two decades. Johnson could face further difficulties tomorrow when the Court of Session in Edinburgh rules in a case bought by anti-Brexit campaigners who want to ensure he seeks an extension to the UK\u2019s membership if he has not reached a deal with the EU by 19 October. Rory Stewart, the former Conservative minister and leadership candidate \u2013 who announced last week that he was leaving the party and would stand as an independent for the job of mayor of London \u2013 said that Johnson risks stoking anger by promising Brexiters a no-deal outcome on 31 October that he cannot deliver as he is bound by the Benn Act to seek an extension to avoid the UK leaving with no agreement. \u201cPoliticians often respond by making extreme and extravagant promises that cannot be delivered (\u2018I will leave on 31 October \u2013 do or die),\u201d he said. And he added: \u201cThey then blame their inevitable failure on some mysterious \u2018establishment\u2019, making people even angrier. \u201cIt is this politics that ultimately divides a country \u2013 it pits rich against poor, north against south, London against the rest, people against parliament, Brexit against Remain. It seeks to corral voters into hostile tribes.\u201d",

Blue Mood Rising is his most assured yet, the guitars and vocals swelling and dipping to match the lyrical intensity, as the well-woven rhythm section chugs confidently. Teaming up with Evermore graduate Dann Hume was a good idea, too: Hume has quietly produced many of the classiest Australian pop songs over the past decade, and Blue Mood Rising is no exception. Didirri\u2019s voice is pushed to the forefront where it belongs, with Hume\u2019s sharp, bright production adding the perfect sheen.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Didirri will be joining <a href=\"https://www.middlekidsmusic.com/\">Middle Kids\u2019 national tour in November</a>, and playing at <a href=\"https://thisthat.com.au/\">This That festival</a> in Newcastle on 9 November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/26/adrian-eagle-on-surviving-self-hate-my-anxiety-was-extreme-i-didnt-want-to-see-anybody\">Adrian Eagle on surviving self-hate: 'My anxiety was extreme.

Bad//Dreems have always excelled when it comes to earworm choruses that careen and crash, and this is among their best, yelping and blasting distortion in such a way that you can\u2019t help imagining them bashing through this song at a sweaty, 200-capacity venue.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Bad//Dreems\u2019 third album Doomsday Ballet is out 18 October.

Amid the white noise of an ad break, a sudden stillness instantly grabs your attention, causing you to look up from whatever device is sapping your attention. Caiti Baker\u2019s slow-burning Gone is punctuated with moments like that, air swirling as the music hangs somewhere in the ether. It forces you to listen carefully \u2013 but even without the pauses, Baker\u2019s formidable songwriting should still have the same effect; nothing less than your full attention will suffice. Gone veers from a lonely ballad into a torch song then quickly back again, warped backing vocals sounding like a haunted chant from deep within the trees. It\u2019s an interesting production choice that transforms this subdued piano-driven song into its own strange beast. Beautiful.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Baker\u2019s new EP Dust (Part 1) is out soon.

And while the former seems to lean a little closer to the material on their previous two albums, it\u2019s breezy tracks like Robbery that will see Lime Cordiale sitting up the business end of the Hottest 100 in a few short months. This has the feel of the Police before Sting got bored and Andy stopped caring, with slight dub influences, falsetto hooks and a mock-reggae accent that \u2013 unlike the Police \u2013 falls on the right side of parody. Post Malone just started a new management company and signed these guys up, so enjoy their next run of gigs, because this time next year they\u2019ll be exclusively playing arenas.

With a bedding that sounds like it could be lifted from a Drake album, and Andallo\u2019s versatile vocal flitting from rapid-fire scattergun to honeyed soul, 180 is ripe for international success. Lil Spacely jumps in at the midpoint with a brief guest verse that complements Andallo\u2019s vocals without swamping the track, meaning you want to hear a lot more of this young Sydney rapper, too. This is Andallo\u2019s show though, and given she recently signed to a major label, it\u2019s a safe bet that before too long she\u2019ll be one of our biggest exports.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out Andallo\u2019s previous single Confidential.</p> <h2><strong>Archie Roach \u2013 Open Up Your Eyes</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Leonard Cohen, Paul Kelly, Bonnie \u2018Prince\u2019 Billy</p> <p>It\u2019s been just shy of three decades since Archie Roach released his sublime debut album Charcoal Lane, and in that time he has become one of Australia\u2019s most invaluable storytellers. Open Up Your Eyes was the first song Roach ever wrote, and this re-recording is made all the more poignant due to the years that have passed between. The song tells a tale of hope and suffering, teaching without lecturing. In three brief verses he manages to detail his own journey, from leaving a foster home at 15, battling with booze and internal torment, and finally finding safe harbour the only way possible: by bearing the storm. Roach manages to capture the eternal struggle of humanity with word economy on par with all-time classics like Eleanor Rigby or The Old Man and the Sea. \u201cI picked up the guitar and started strumming and \u2013 bang \u2013 it just came, the melody and the rhythm and everything, all at once,\u201d he recalls. This is life-affirming music and Archie\u2019s tale of resilience could just be the soothing salve some of his lost listeners need right now.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Roach\u2019s ninth album Tell Me Why contains a mixture of reimagined Roach classics, unreleased songs and covers. It will be out on 1 November, along with his memoir of the same name.</p> <h2><strong>Cool Sounds \u2013 Hula Hoop Group</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>White Fence, Montero, Ariel Pink</p> <p>Cool Sounds is not just a clever name. This Melbourne five-piece have just released their third studio album, and rather than restraining their oddball approach, they have doubled down on the insanity, with the results sounding like a Neil Young song being covered by Muppets whose felt bodies have been dipped in acid. Although Hula Hoop Group sounds like a cut from the outsider artists that appeared on the Songs In The Key Of Z compilations, this is by no means impenetrable: the music is bright and catchy, the hooks are plentiful, and a silly slide guitar bounces around in slow motion giving off summery holiday vibes, where the tar melts on the road, sunspots hover like flies and the heat warps your brain just a little.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Cool Sounds\u2019 album More To Enjoy is out now.

Unlike Kanye, though, Kwame\u2019s confidence never comes across as hubris (despite numerous boasts). The laid-back way in which he halts to let the beat catch up, bursts into sing-song, laughs, chatters, and the thrown-off freestyle feel of his rhymes suggests that \u2013 as he predicts \u2013 this won\u2019t end up on radio, but that\u2019s clearly not the intention here.

Flume matches her intensity with one of his most inventive sonic beds to date, a minimalist beat interjected with chaotic backwards keyboard parts that sound like he is manning a drum machine and rewinding an overdue video tape at the same time. Sitting somewhere between Noel Gallagher\u2019s Beatles-cribbing experiments with the Chemical Brothers, and Kate Bush had she gone clubbing on the moors, this is a great avant-garde pop single.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Flume is playing at Listen In on 4 October in Auckland and 6 October in Adelaide, and Listen Out on 5 October in Sydney.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Didirri \u2013 Blue Mood Rising For fans of: Oh Mercy, Crowded House, Powderfinger For a songwriter with only one EP under his belt, Melbourne\u2019s Didirri writes impressively mature compositions: tight, powerful songs that sound like they could have slotted on to FM playlists any time over the past half-century. Blue Mood Rising is his most assured yet, the guitars and vocals swelling and dipping to match the lyrical intensity, as the well-woven rhythm section chugs confidently. Teaming up with Evermore graduate Dann Hume was a good idea, too: Hume has quietly produced many of the classiest Australian pop songs over the past decade, and Blue Mood Rising is no exception. Didirri\u2019s voice is pushed to the forefront where it belongs, with Hume\u2019s sharp, bright production adding the perfect sheen. For more: Didirri will be joining Middle Kids\u2019 national tour in November, and playing at This That festival in Newcastle on 9 November. Bad//Dreems \u2013 Morning Rain For fans of: Mudhoney, Violent Soho, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever Starting with a twanging bassline that sounds like it emerged from Sub Pop luminary Jack Endino\u2019s studio, before making gleeful use of the well-trodden soft/loud, verse/chorus dynamics that permeated grunge, it\u2019s only Ben Marwe\u2019s charmingly laconic drawl that indicates this track didn\u2019t actually come from Seattle during the early 90s. Bad//Dreems have always excelled when it comes to earworm choruses that careen and crash, and this is among their best, yelping and blasting distortion in such a way that you can\u2019t help imagining them bashing through this song at a sweaty, 200-capacity venue. For more: Bad//Dreems\u2019 third album Doomsday Ballet is out 18 October. They are touring nationally in October and November. Caiti Baker \u2013 Gone For fans of: Holly Throsby, Antony and the Johnsons, Joni Mitchell One of the most effective TV advertising techniques is silence. Amid the white noise of an ad break, a sudden stillness instantly grabs your attention, causing you to look up from whatever device is sapping your attention. Caiti Baker\u2019s slow-burning Gone is punctuated with moments like that, air swirling as the music hangs somewhere in the ether. It forces you to listen carefully \u2013 but even without the pauses, Baker\u2019s formidable songwriting should still have the same effect; nothing less than your full attention will suffice. Gone veers from a lonely ballad into a torch song then quickly back again, warped backing vocals sounding like a haunted chant from deep within the trees. It\u2019s an interesting production choice that transforms this subdued piano-driven song into its own strange beast. Beautiful. For more: Baker\u2019s new EP Dust (Part 1) is out soon. In the mean time, check out her debut album Zinc. Lime Cordiale \u2013 Robbery For fans of: the Police, Arctic Monkeys, Razorlight Lime Cordiale are fast proving themselves to be one of the most impressive bands in the land, leaping from May\u2019s Inappropriate Behaviour, which sounds like it came off an NME sampler released around the time of Inbetweeners, to this spritely, bouncing number.

      "bodyText": "On Monday, the activist group Extinction Rebellion will begin a week of global protests. In Brisbane, home to the grassroots organisation\u2019s first Australian chapter, activists are preparing to stage protests around the city. At the group\u2019s headquarters in Woolloongabba, a busy training schedule is under way. It is hosting introductory sessions at local libraries planning two large-scale marches, with a litany of other \u201cnon-violent disruptive actions\u201d. Since the group conducted its first action in Australia in April, there have been more than 170 arrests, with penalties ranging from a warning to a $1,500 fine. When new laws designed to target the tactics used by Extinction Rebellion pass parliament, those penalties will escalate. The use of a purpose-designed \u201cdangerous attachment device to disrupt lawful activities\u201d, referring to the Extinction Rebellion tactic of locking on to railways and roads, will attract a $6,500 fine or two years\u2019 imprisonment. Peaceful protest, the Queensland government says, is only acceptable if it does not disrupt people going about their ordinary business. But disruption is the point. \u201cWe are using civil disobedience to cause economic disruption and a disruption to business as usual,\u201d Extinction Rebellion south-east Queensland member Emma Dorge says. \u201cWithout disruption, our voices are not being heard.\u201d She is not deterred by harsher penalties. \u201cWe are fighting against extinction,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are doing what\u2019s necessary in the face of complete inaction from governments on climate change.\u201d Queensland has proposed two new amendments this year designed to clamp down on protests: increased trespass penalties aimed at animal welfare protests, currently going through a parliamentary committee, and the lock-on laws. It has also introduced biosecurity regulations with on-the-spot fines for entering an agricultural premises. New South Wales has also introduced new $1,000 on-the-spot penalties through biosecurity regulations and is considering draft laws with broad new trespass penalties. When the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, was opposition leader in 2016, he ceremonially ripped up anti-protest laws proposed by his predecessor, but his government has also said it will increase penalties for trespass. The reforms are aimed at animal welfare protesters described by the attorney general as \u201cmushy-headed vegans\u201d. Victoria is holding a parliamentary inquiry to determine if it ought to strengthen trespass laws, following uproar about a $1 fine levied against an activist who stole a goat from a Gippsland cheese cafe. The Law Institute of Victoria has suggested the government instead introduce laws promoting greater transparency in the agriculture industry. Tasmania, still bruised from a 2017 high court decision that struck down its anti-protest laws, is working on amended legislation to reintroduce the laws. That high court ruling \u2013 that environmental protests are political and protected under the constitutional implied freedom of political communication \u2013 could potentially apply to Queensland and NSW laws as proposed. \u201cWhen we see the positioning that\u2019s been coming out of the government we tend to look at it through two filters,\u201d the Wilderness Society national director, Lyndon Schneiders, says. \u201cOne is: is what they are proposing actually legal? And secondly, what are they trying to achieve politically?\u201d The NSW Nature Conservation Council chief executive, Chris Gambian, says the NSW legislation is framed as a narrow provision supporting farmers but could actually work against their interests by penalising almost all protest actions. Farmers have been heavily involved in environmental protests in Australia, particularly against coal seam gas. The Bentley Blockade, a seven-year protest in the Northern Rivers region which successfully halted gas exploration and is cited as inspiration by Dorge and other Extinction Rebellion members as an example of successful activism, was underpinned by farmers. And when more than 300,000 people join climate strikes around Australia, can protesting still be considered a fringe activity? \u201cThere is a culture war going on that is trying to pit those people that care about the environment against other people, and I think that\u2019s incredibly worrying,\u201d Gambian says. Take these comments from Peter Dutton. \u201cPeople should take these names, and the photos of these people, and distribute them as far and wide as we can so that we shame these people,\u201d said the home affairs minister in his regular spot on Sydney\u2019s 2GB radio. \u201cLet their families know what you think of their behaviour \u2026 We should push back on it because these people are a scourge, they are doing the wrong thing. If you want to protest, do it peacefully.\u201d In this context, \u201cpeaceful\u201d can be taken to mean \u201cunobtrusive\u201d. Dutton also suggested protesters should face mandatory minimum sentences and murmured support for host Ray Hadley\u2019s suggestion that the welfare payments of protesters be restricted. In the world of talkback radio, the Venn diagram of ordinary working Australians and people who protest are two circles that never meet. Reality has more overlap. Gambian is a spokesperson for a loose coalition of environment groups, Unions NSW and legal groups that have banded together to oppose the proposed NSW anti-protest laws, which would result in protesters facing fines of up to $22,000. A similar coalition of 80 organisations, from unions to religious groups, staved off the most recent anti-protest laws in WA and is waiting to see the draft of the new proposed laws. \u201cIt was a matter that brought together a really broad cross-section of society,\u201d Perth-based public advocacy lawyer Kate Davis says. \u201cI don\u2019t think any laws that are targeted at restricting the right to protest have a place in our democracy.\u201d The proposed NSW laws, like new federal laws passed in August, are targeted at \u201cfarm invasion\u201d protests from animal activists who have targeted abattoirs, factory farming operations and family-run farms in the past 18-months. They make use of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act and are \u201cbreathtakingly broad,\u201d says Gambian, and would capture protests on environmental grounds, including anti-mining protests. That act was amended in 2016 to introduce a $5,500 penalty for aggravated unlawful entry to enclosed lands. It was up for review next month, but that review has now been superseded by the proposed Right to Farm Bill. The proposed amendments would increase the penalty for aggravated trespass to $13,200 or 12 months\u2019 jail. If a person was accompanied by two or more other people, or taken to be interfering with the conduct of the business, they would face a $22,000 fine or three years\u2019 jail. \u201cEnclosed land is any land that has a fence around it,\u201d Gambian says. \u201cIncluding a temporary fence. Including a temporary fence erected while the protest is going on.\u201d It includes public land, such as state parliament. Emily Howie, legal director for the Human Rights Law Centre, says the proposed laws could run afoul of the same constitutional provisions that allowed the former Greens leader Bob Brown to win his high court challenge against the Tasmanian anti-protest laws. If the laws were found to be denying Australians their constitutional freedom to talk about things that are politically important, Howie says, they could be found to be invalid. Moves by governments to protect businesses from disruption are legitimate, Howie says, but they must be \u201creasonable and proportionate\u201d. \u201cThe last thing that we want is for laws that are meant to be protecting business to in fact be deterring people from engaging in peaceful and lawful protest and our concern about this bill in New South Wales is that is exactly what it does,\u201d she says.",

At capacity, the scheme can add an extra 180 million litres a day to the dam, but it has never been completely turned on and is currently in \u201ccare and maintenance mode\u201d. That leaves Perth\u2019s Groundwater Replenishment Scheme as the only operational scheme. It adds about 14 billion litres of recycled water to the city\u2019s aquifers every year, with work to double capacity due for completion next year. \u201cIn Perth, they don\u2019t talk about drought. They talk about climate change,\u201d Lovell says. \u201cClimate change has hit Perth harder than almost any other city in the world \u2013 it\u2019s almost forgotten how to rain there in a city of 2 million people.\u201d According to Perth\u2019s Water Corporation, before 1975 the city\u2019s dams would get an average of 420 billion litres of streamflow each year. So far this year, Perth\u2019s dams have received only 37.7 billion litres. But as well as dams, about 40% of the water for the city\u2019s main supply scheme comes from groundwater that acts as a long-term storage for the recycled water. Lovell says the way Perth\u2019s Water Corporation presented the option of purified recycled water to the community is seen as a model of how it should be done \u2013 a patient three-year trial, widespread community consultation, the creation of a community advisory panel and more than 70 briefings to stakeholders. About 11,000 people have walked through a purpose-built visitor\u2019s centre down the access road to the Beenyup Wastewater Treatment Plant. Perth\u2019s groundwater replenishment scheme takes wastewater and puts it through filtration to take out suspended materials, then uses reverse osmosis to remove dissolved materials before blasting the water with ultraviolet light to kill micro-organisms. Then, the water is fed into the aquifer. All the water drawn from the aquifer is treated again before it\u2019s released for drinking water. Prof Stuart Khan, of the University of New South Wales, says the kind of patient and inclusive approach taken in Perth should be a model for how recycled water schemes are presented to communities. Instead, communities have been left with the only option of waiting for rain or building desalination plants, which are roughly twice as expensive as recycling water. \u201cWhen you leave it late, the easiest option is seawater desalination,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s what you do when you run out of time. \u201cIn Australia, we\u2019ve never been prepared to be all that patient \u2013 at least on the east coast. You don\u2019t make plans for water when you are running out. You have to look at the longer-term horizon.\u201d Khan co-authored a report earlier this year on recycling drinking water for the industry-funded group Water Research Australia. He highlighted a host of pioneering schemes around the world using wastewater to supplement drinking water, in Belgium, Singapore, South Africa, Namibia and projects across the United States. Lovell has been taking examples like this in to meetings in Canberra. Earlier this year, he was touting a report that called for the federal government to \u201crecognise the importance of having all water supply options on the table, including purified recycled water for drinking.\u201d Lovell says recycled water for drinking should be the \u201cnext frontier\u201d as communities try to build their resilience to drought and climate change. Khan says Australia is already at the point where it has to rethink its relationship with recycled water. \u201cIf we leave this any later, we will have a disaster with cities running out of water. That\u2019s not the kind of environment that lets you have a sensible conversation about water recycling. \u201cIn many ways, Toowoomba scared the politicians. The politicians still remember it \u2013 they saw it as a poison chalice and didn\u2019t want what happened to the mayor of Toowoomba to happen to them.\u201d Perhaps ironically, if Brisbane\u2019s water dam levels drop from their current levels of 63.5% to below 60%, then Queensland will start a two-year program to restart its wastewater recycling scheme flowing into Wivenhoe dam that now also feeds Toowoomba.",

      "bodyText": "As Scott Morrison took to his feet in the imperial surrounds of Sydney town hall on Thursday night for a major foreign policy speech, he quietly observed he found himself governing at \u201can unusually delicate moment in time\u201d. His government had spent a frenzied week caught in the chaos and calumny of the Trump administration, with Morrison himself facing questions about exactly what he had offered his ally in the White House. At the same time, he had been attempting to harden Australia\u2019s position against a bellicose China without harming too greatly his country\u2019s relationship with its most crucial trading partner. While conceding his \u201cdelicate moment\u201d in history, rather than tread cautiously, Morrison used the speech to take a barely veiled swipe at the United Nations and the international institutions that Australia has previously championed. Morrison revealed \u2013 in this week of tumult both at home and abroad \u2013 that his natural political instincts on the global stage are far more closely aligned to Trump and his populist fellow travellers than they are to decades of Australian foreign policy commitment to multilateralism. While Morrison\u2019s position may be more nuanced than the nakedly nativist Trump, the same fundamental \u201cnation-first\u201d prerogative informs his foreign policy outlook. Morrison\u2019s insistence \u201cAustralia\u2019s international engagement will be squarely driven by Australia\u2019s national interests\u201d is unremarkable language for any leader. Channelling John Howard, he cast this as a forthright but co-operative independence: \u201cWe will decide our interests and the circumstances in which we seek to pursue them.\u201d But what followed \u2013 condemning \u201ca new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies\u201d \u2013 echoed not only Trump, but Brexit figures such as Nigel Farage in form. \u201cWe should avoid any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community and, worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and the rule of law, can define its national interests.

Morrison and his government are now central players in the current furore enveloping the Trump administration, with proposed impeachment proceedings enraging the president, while Australia finds itself being criticised for an eagerness to assist in what is widely seen as a partisan inquiry pursued by Trump for domestic political purposes. Alexander Downer, Australia\u2019s former ambassador to London, is viewed by some as the catalyst for FBI director Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2013 having passed on information from Trump aide George Papadopoulos that Moscow possessed incriminating \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton. The Mueller inquiry report ultimately did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia, but its findings did not exonerate the president of collusion, and outlined an extensive obstruction of justice case against him. In May, Trump phoned Morrison and asked for his help in finding evidence to discredit the Mueller inquiry. Morrison agreed to assist.

Of course it is not welfare. Perish the thought! If it were welfare then the prime minister and the rest of his government would be seeking ways to turn the lives of the farmers into misery \u2013 to belittle them with naked scorn and snide condescension. But heck, let not the absence of any horrendous welfare recipients nearby hold Morrison back from twisting the knife into the gut of those lacking the spiritual fortitude required to accumulate wealth. A day without slapping down the less deserving is like a day without prayer, and when you worship at a church that holds dear prosperity theology (well, you could hardly hold it cheap), then the two go hand in hand. After declaring \u201cthis isn\u2019t \u2013 this isn\u2019t welfare\u201d (so horrendous is the suggestion, the phrase caught in his throat), Morrison added, \u201cthis is really just helping people make sure that they maintain a viability\u201d. All those attempting to subsist on Newstart must be glad Morrison has finally come clean that he doesn\u2019t believe welfare payments actually are about helping people maintain a viable life. These farmers \u2013 not like those layabout climate-change protestors using that child, Greta Thunberg, to do their bidding \u2013 were \u201cimportant assets for our country, our farming assets, their lands, they can remain productive; that they can stay on the land is really important to Australia\u201d. \u201cYou work hard,\u201d he cried.

Cripes, if we\u2019re going to have to offer support for people on welfare, pretty soon you\u2019re treating them like farmers, and before you know it you are going to have to brag about overpaying them!

After that, the actual amount of new money is so scarce it almost deserves the name welfare.

They see a hollow club representing the big end of town, with mercenaries for players and fair-weather fans.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t support the Roosters \u2013 going against the wishes of my Queenslander dad and my Bunnies-supporting brother, who grew up across town in Newtown \u2013 because I wanted to be a lemon-chinos-wearing rugby league villain. I thought there was something about my suburb to be proud of.</p> <p>I supported the Roosters because they came to our primary school and passed footballs to us. We met Luke Ricketson, Matt Sing and, most excitingly of all, Brad Fittler.</p> <p>It was hard not to like him. He was a buffoon and a genius, he was a glamour player with flair who would still run the ball forward with the stoicism and fearlessness of some workhorse second-rower long numbed to pain. Watching him, he showed you, you didn\u2019t have to be one thing.</p> <p>Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs have never been one thing.</p> <p>Point Piper and Vaucluse might have always had money, but Bondi, filled with flats instead of quarter-acre blocks, was shunned by the monied classes of Sydney. It\u2019s hard to imagine Bondi once had 5% public housing. It was European Jews, Turks, Greeks and Italians who moved in to cheap rentals and figured out the beach was a great place to live.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90cf2c0741981e8dce173eef4c4480a0e305a41d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90cf2c0741981e8dce173eef4c4480a0e305a41d/0_98_3859_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Roosters\u2019 Latrell Mitchell signs autographs at the NRL Fan Fest event at Martin Place in Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Roosters\u2019 Latrell Mitchell signs autographs at the NRL Fan Fest event in Sydney\u2019s Martin Place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By and large, those were the people who went to the public schools I went to. The Sun-Herald ran a picture of my Year 1 class at Bellevue Hill Public School in a piece on multiculturalism, with the headline: \u201cOur happy and glorious future.\u201d</p> <p>From Darlinghurst to Bondi, Sydney\u2019s east was fairly eccentric in the 1990s.

The pubs have gone from pokie den boozers to having fitouts on a par with most five-star hotels. The pub steak at the Robin Hood is now dry-aged for 120 days, and the Coogee Palace Hotel has been replaced by a <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/southern-courier/justin-hemmes-splashed-6m-on-coogee-pavilion-makeover/news-story/7dbb3f31ae4e7f139563e2790675f07a\">seafood and pizza oven amusement park courtesy of Justin Hemmes</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8670af1b7f8f152730acd4c33d924f789eef7774\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8670af1b7f8f152730acd4c33d924f789eef7774/0_135_4059_2435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Verrills of the Roosters greets supporters at the NRL Fan Fest event on Thursday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Roosters\u2019 Sam Verrills greets supporters at the NRL Fan Fest event on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Roosters games have been a place to see the embers of the eastern suburbs I grew up in. Rugby league is a primal game, it\u2019s very simple and very violent, and it\u2019s hard to hide anything when you\u2019re watching it. In that passion and fervour of a half-empty Roosters home game you can still see the characters and kooks who made the eastern suburbs great.</p> <p>You can\u2019t refurbish a community entirely. The neck tattoos still peak above the crisp poplin shirts and the Roosters are still the team that play the working class sport, even if it\u2019s now in the suburb with some of the most valuable real estate in the country.</p> <p>It\u2019s a club where players come to transform themselves. From <a href=\"https://www.nrl.com/hall-of-fame/players/arthur-beetson/\">Artie Beetson</a> to Brad Fitler and now Luke Keary and Latrell Mitchell, players come to the Roosters and don\u2019t fit in a box. We get to see them choose who they want to be at Easts.</p> <p>To be a fan of the club is to know you can be two things at once. We are fair-weather diehards, working class latte-sippers and affluent rugby league tragics \u2013 and not all of us wear lemon chinos.</p> <p>If that doesn\u2019t convince you there is some heart to the Roosters ahead of the NRL grand final, I\u2019ll leave you with the oldest refrain our club has: at least we\u2019re not Manly.</p>",

The Roosters have been as dominant a team as we\u2019ve seen since the heyday of the Melbourne Storm, except the Roosters are doing it while playing the most exciting football in the competition. But when you tell someone you\u2019re a Roosters supporter, they tend not to be envious of those riches, but confused about what it is about the club you can actually invest your heart in. Easts have no spiritual suburban home like Leichhardt Oval or Redfern Park. Instead we\u2019ve always been ensconced at the latest entertainment dome at Moore Park. (The last incarnation of the Sydney Football Stadium had a 27-metre-wide television screen in it and with any luck the next one won\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve left the house at all.) Most see the Roosters as anathema to what the sport of rugby league is about. They see a hollow club representing the big end of town, with mercenaries for players and fair-weather fans. I didn\u2019t support the Roosters \u2013 going against the wishes of my Queenslander dad and my Bunnies-supporting brother, who grew up across town in Newtown \u2013 because I wanted to be a lemon-chinos-wearing rugby league villain. I thought there was something about my suburb to be proud of. I supported the Roosters because they came to our primary school and passed footballs to us. We met Luke Ricketson, Matt Sing and, most excitingly of all, Brad Fittler. It was hard not to like him. He was a buffoon and a genius, he was a glamour player with flair who would still run the ball forward with the stoicism and fearlessness of some workhorse second-rower long numbed to pain. Watching him, he showed you, you didn\u2019t have to be one thing. Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs have never been one thing. Point Piper and Vaucluse might have always had money, but Bondi, filled with flats instead of quarter-acre blocks, was shunned by the monied classes of Sydney. It\u2019s hard to imagine Bondi once had 5% public housing. It was European Jews, Turks, Greeks and Italians who moved in to cheap rentals and figured out the beach was a great place to live. By and large, those were the people who went to the public schools I went to. The Sun-Herald ran a picture of my Year 1 class at Bellevue Hill Public School in a piece on multiculturalism, with the headline: \u201cOur happy and glorious future.\u201d From Darlinghurst to Bondi, Sydney\u2019s east was fairly eccentric in the 1990s. At Bar Coluzzi and Tropicana Caffe in Darlinghurst, people like Rene Rivkin, Rodney Adler and Malcolm Turnbull split macchiatos with housos and chancers. Kids from the Woolloomooloo housing commission fell into the same catchment area as kids from Dover Heights and after the buses pulled into Bondi Junction, they\u2019d convene over McChicken and cheeses to discuss who had rolled who, and who had been a chatty-bum (disgusting person) on the weekend. I\u2019m not naive enough to think it was a classless paradise, and the bonds of that community counted for very little when decisions had to be made about public school funding or public housing, but it was definitely strange and special. Since then, a lot has changed. The pubs have gone from pokie den boozers to having fitouts on a par with most five-star hotels. The pub steak at the Robin Hood is now dry-aged for 120 days, and the Coogee Palace Hotel has been replaced by a seafood and pizza oven amusement park courtesy of Justin Hemmes. But Roosters games have been a place to see the embers of the eastern suburbs I grew up in. Rugby league is a primal game, it\u2019s very simple and very violent, and it\u2019s hard to hide anything when you\u2019re watching it. In that passion and fervour of a half-empty Roosters home game you can still see the characters and kooks who made the eastern suburbs great. You can\u2019t refurbish a community entirely. The neck tattoos still peak above the crisp poplin shirts and the Roosters are still the team that play the working class sport, even if it\u2019s now in the suburb with some of the most valuable real estate in the country. It\u2019s a club where players come to transform themselves. From Artie Beetson to Brad Fitler and now Luke Keary and Latrell Mitchell, players come to the Roosters and don\u2019t fit in a box. We get to see them choose who they want to be at Easts. To be a fan of the club is to know you can be two things at once. We are fair-weather diehards, working class latte-sippers and affluent rugby league tragics \u2013 and not all of us wear lemon chinos. If that doesn\u2019t convince you there is some heart to the Roosters ahead of the NRL grand final, I\u2019ll leave you with the oldest refrain our club has: at least we\u2019re not Manly.",

      "body": "<p>Bring up Harriet the Spy at any queer gathering and you\u2019ll hear at least a few happy shouts of appreciation. For many, the book offered a rare chance to not feel like the odd one out, or better still, to be glad that they were the odd one out. Out of love, I have two copies of Harriet the Spy. One is from 1974, with the original illustrations by Louise Fitzhugh in all their heartfelt precociousness. The other is from 1981, and rather than any illustrations, the cover instead hosts a photo of a girl dressed up as Harriet, and this is the version I remember most fondly. In keeping with Fitzhugh\u2019s iconic vision, Harriet proudly wears the same faux-spectacles, crumpled jeans with big turn-ups, the oversized hoodie, the pair of sneakers with long laces, and the leather belt from which hangs an assortment of tools that I always envied as a preteen.</p> <p>I still dress like Harriet to this day, right down to the cuffs on my baggy denim. And, as many Facebook photos from the early 2000s will attest, there was also a time when I even wore the completely pointless black glasses without lenses. I\u2019m pretty sure if you zoomed in on a few particularly pretentious photos from 2005, you\u2019d even find a moleskine notebook folded in my back pocket too.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In other words: Harriet the Spy is resplendent with Big Dyke Energy. When I found out later in life that Louise Fitzhugh was queer too, it was no surprise. There is, in fact, a legacy of kids\u2019 books by queer illustrators and authors produced in the same golden era of children\u2019s literature: Maurice Sendak (Where the Wild Things Are); Margaret Wise Brown (Goodnight Moon); Arnold Lobel (Frog and Toad) and Tove Jansson (the Moomin series); to name a few. These are all books that are compassionate and, more importantly, contain narratives that are more concerned with the highs and lows of being alive than boring old virtue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0fa817e2712b256db6b99da003ecc4c289c5b2f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fa817e2712b256db6b99da003ecc4c289c5b2f7/0_0_422_648/326.jpg\" alt=\"Harriet the spy cover\" width=\"326\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Harriet the Spy blurred the lines between right and wrong in a way that liberated my nine-year-old mind. As a kid who already felt left out by the mechanisms of femininity that everyone around me seemed to adopt with ease, Harriet was the blue denim baby butch I needed among the endless ballerina narratives.

      "bodyText": "Bring up Harriet the Spy at any queer gathering and you\u2019ll hear at least a few happy shouts of appreciation. For many, the book offered a rare chance to not feel like the odd one out, or better still, to be glad that they were the odd one out. Out of love, I have two copies of Harriet the Spy. One is from 1974, with the original illustrations by Louise Fitzhugh in all their heartfelt precociousness. The other is from 1981, and rather than any illustrations, the cover instead hosts a photo of a girl dressed up as Harriet, and this is the version I remember most fondly. In keeping with Fitzhugh\u2019s iconic vision, Harriet proudly wears the same faux-spectacles, crumpled jeans with big turn-ups, the oversized hoodie, the pair of sneakers with long laces, and the leather belt from which hangs an assortment of tools that I always envied as a preteen. I still dress like Harriet to this day, right down to the cuffs on my baggy denim. And, as many Facebook photos from the early 2000s will attest, there was also a time when I even wore the completely pointless black glasses without lenses. I\u2019m pretty sure if you zoomed in on a few particularly pretentious photos from 2005, you\u2019d even find a moleskine notebook folded in my back pocket too. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In other words: Harriet the Spy is resplendent with Big Dyke Energy. When I found out later in life that Louise Fitzhugh was queer too, it was no surprise. There is, in fact, a legacy of kids\u2019 books by queer illustrators and authors produced in the same golden era of children\u2019s literature: Maurice Sendak (Where the Wild Things Are); Margaret Wise Brown (Goodnight Moon); Arnold Lobel (Frog and Toad) and Tove Jansson (the Moomin series); to name a few. These are all books that are compassionate and, more importantly, contain narratives that are more concerned with the highs and lows of being alive than boring old virtue. Harriet the Spy blurred the lines between right and wrong in a way that liberated my nine-year-old mind. As a kid who already felt left out by the mechanisms of femininity that everyone around me seemed to adopt with ease, Harriet was the blue denim baby butch I needed among the endless ballerina narratives. Back then, I didn\u2019t yet have the words for what I felt fizzing through my insides, and even now, 15 years after coming out, I\u2019m only just learning to feel comfortable with how I present: non-binary, butch. Harriet\u2019s dedication to her spy route made perfect sense to me too. When you\u2019re an outsider, observing the machinations of other people can often feel like you\u2019re doing the work of a spy. It was a relief to read the extracts from Harriet\u2019s notebook, where the \u201cnormal\u201d society she reported on from her spy route was so elegantly and brutally reduced to nothingness in a few sentences, always in her assertive, trademark caps-lock font. Despite not having any openly gay characters (the book was first published in 1964) Harriet the Spy still has excellent queer morals. Re-reading it as an adult, I feel myself getting teary over the necessary \u201clittle lies\u201d that Ole Golly, Harriet\u2019s ex-nanny, highlighted in her parting letter.

Poignantly, Ole Golly then signs off her letter with, \u201cBut to yourself you must tell the truth\u201d. What queer hasn\u2019t told \u201clittle lies\u201d in order to survive?

Barnier was clear on Saturday that a no-deal outcome would be Johnson\u2019s responsibility, while the prime minister and Cummings have their strategy planned well in advance \u2013 to lay responsibility for that outcome and any turbulence it could cause firmly at the door of the EU.

This is the best chance we have to break the deadlock and leave with a fair and reasonable deal.\u201d Both sides are entrenched and few see how a breakthrough can now be achieved before the crucial EU summit on 17-18 October. If Johnson were to give ground to the EU now, he would risk losing the alliance of support he has assembled in parliament that includes the DUP and anti-EU Conservative MPs. Were he to give in over customs arrangements or the \u201cStormont lock\u201d, which gives Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly the right to decide every four years if it wants to continue to apply EU legislation to traded goods, he would face the same opposition that defeated Theresa May\u2019s deal.

      "bodyText": "What a fine win for Crystal Palace. The match could have gone either way, and West Ham may question the accuracy of VAR on the winning goal, but it\u2019s hard to begrudge Palace. They were resourceful, disciplined and had a soup\u00e7on of brilliance in the shape of Wilfried Zaha. Peep peep! Crystal Palace are fourth in the Premier League. 90+5 min Guaita saves from Diop\u2019s header. Fornals floated the free-kick to the far post, where the stretching Benteke headed it up in the air. Noble cushioned a volley back across goal towards Diop, whose header on the run was too close to Guaita. 90+4 min Zabaleta is fouled just outside the area by Townsend, who could have been booked twice in the last couple of minutes. 90+3 min \u201cWell, the top two are probably settled but third and fourth seem to be up for grabs,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cWhat a fine match by Crystal Palace.\u201d Probably! 90+2 min West Ham appeal for a penalty when Haller goes over after a tangle with Cahill. Nothing doing. 90+1 min There will be six added minutes. Benteke came on for Ayew. The goal, since you asked, came when the free-kick for that foul on Zaha was only half cleared. Townsend curled in a deep cross from the right, Kelly headed coolly back across goal and Ayew shoved it under Roberto from six yards. 90 min Jordan Ayew is replaced by SOMEONE I DON\u2019T KNOW WHO OKAY. There were two checks \u2013 the first for offside against Kelly, the second when he headed the ball across the area for Ayew to score from close-range. Both were extremely tight, but VAR judged that both were fine. Two-one! 88 min Actually, I think is going to be given... 87 min: Ayew has a goal disallowed for offside! It\u2019ll be checked by VAR but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the right decision. 86 min Fredericks is booked for pulling back Zaha, who has caused problems since moving to the left. 85 min van Aanholt makes a vital interception, nicking the ball off Haller as he is about to shoot. The chance came after a fine run and pass from Wilshere. 84 min The match is in danger of petering out. West Ham make their final change, with Pablo Zabaleta replacing the injured Aaron Cresswell. 83 min Zaha is fouled just outside the area on the left by Fredericks. Michael Oliver gives nothing. 82 min Palace make a change, with Andros Townsend replacing a weary James McCarthy. He\u2019s had a good game. 81 min It\u2019s been a frustrating game for West Ham. Although they\u2019ve had a few chances, they haven\u2019t had any sustained spells of pressure. Palace have been excellent. 80 min If it stays like this, West Ham will go fourth and Palace eighth. 78 min Another West Ham change: Jack Wilshere replaces Andriy Yarmolenko. 75 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cNice of you to let the late, great David Coleman take over MBM duties for the first goal from his commentary box in the sky. Has there ever been a better way of describing the opening goal in a game?\u201d Nope. From memory, Coleman didn\u2019t always limit \u201cone-nil!\u201d to the opening goal either. 74 min It\u2019s hard to pick a winner here. It\u2019s not like Romania v England in 1998, when only one team was ever going to score. 70 min \u201cWatching this pair, both teams seem stuffed with capability,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cIs there any truth in this assertion that it\u2019s the best league, that on any given Sunday any team can beat any of the others? They do seem incredibly well coached throughout and to have skills and application in abundance. Is it my imagination or have they all upped their game in the era of Klopp and Pep?\u201d I do agree that the standard around the middle of the Premier League is higher than for much of the decade. Mind you, it might be an illusion caused by United and Arsenal downing their game so spectacularly. I\u2019d say the standard at the top is the highest it\u2019s been since the late 1990s. 69 min Haller\u2019s snap-volley from Fredericks\u2019 cross is blocked by Cahill. That was a fine effort. 68 min Manuel Lanzini, who looks a bit rusty, is replaced by Pablo Fornals. 65 min After a truly diabolical start, this has become a really interesting game. Van Aanholt scores, dancing round the ball before sliding it into the bottom-left corner. Roberto went the wrong way. 62 min With Milovojevic suspended, Patrick van Aanholt will take the penalty. Kouyate\u2019s volleyed cross hits Rice\u2019s arm in the area. He was only a yard away but his arm was in an unnatural position, as if he was dancing the funky chicken. 60 min Haller is booked for a foul on McArthur. 59 min Noble drives over the bar from 20 yards. Guaita had it covered. 58 min Zaha\u2019s near-post cross is kneed well wide by Ayew, under pressure from the impressive Diop. That was a lovely team goal. It started with some rat-a-tat passing from West Ham to get out of a tight spot in their own half, and continued for another 30 seconds or so as they probed for an opening. Eventually Yarmolenko played in the overlapping Fredericks, who ran at van Aanholt and drove a low cross into a crowded penalty area. Haller reacted quickest, stretching to force the ball past Guaita from 10 yards. One-nil! 52 min Ogbonna misses a good chance, slapping a volley over the bar from eight yards after a free-kick ricocheted around the Palace box. His control was excellent, but he couldn\u2019t quite get over the subsequent shot. 51 min Joel Ward is booked for pulling back Felipe Anderson. 50 min Zaha has started the second half brightly. Palace have had a lot more of the ball than expected. 46 min Peep peep! West Ham begin the second half. Half-time reading Peep peep! That wasn\u2019t exactly an epiphany-inducing half of football, though it did get better towards half-time. See you in 15 minutes for the second half. 45+2 min Lanzini misses a good chance, whistling a low shot wide from the edge of the box. He was set up beautifully by Felipe Anderson, who cushioned a volleyed pass into his path. 44 min Yarmolenko is booked for a late tackle on Ward. Palace have been the better team for much of this first half. 42 min McCarthy\u2019s stinging long-range shot is flapped away by Roberto, diving to his left. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d laments Jamie Carragher, who thought he should have caught it. \u201cIt\u2019s a cameras job.\u201d 40 min Guaita makes another smart reaction save to stop an own goal from Kelly. Felipe Anderson\u2019s cross from the left pinballed around the six-yard box before hitting Kelly to force a good save from Guaita. 39 min After an abysmal start, the last 10 minutes have been pretty enjoyable. 36 min: Fredericks clears off the line! Zaha made the chance with a glorious bit of skill, turning past Cresswell in a phonebox by the touchline. Then he drew tjhe keeper Roberto before pulling the ball to Schlupp on the six-yard line. He mistimed a shot that looped towards goal, and Fredericks cleared it off the line. 32 min Felipe Anderson misses a good chance. Fredericks picked him out with a nice, lofted cross beyond the far post, but Anderson sliced his volley so badly that it went straight back out to the right wing. Seconds later, he forced a decent save from Guaita with a stopping header from 12 yards, but the first chance was the big one. 29 min: Fine save from Guaita! A moment of quality at last. Noble threaded a superb pass down the inside-right channel to Yarmolenko; he drove a first-time cross towards the near post, where Haller got away from Kelly and hit a close-range shot that was instinctively saved by Guaita. 25 min Ayew goes down after wearing Ogbonna\u2019s arm in the face. I don\u2019t think it was deliberate, and VAR didn\u2019t get involved. 25 min Palace are having slightly the better of the game now. Cahill heads a corner down into the six-yard box, prompting a bit of a scramble before the ball is cleared by a West Ham defender. 23 min Ayew\u2019s shot from the edge of the area is blocked, I think by one of his own team-mates. 21 min See 19 min. This is dismal. 19 min I don\u2019t know what to say. There\u2019s nothing whatsoever to report. 15 min This, if true, is quite amusing: apparently Sadio Mane started clutching the wrong ankle after earning Liverpool\u2019s matchwinning penalty against Leicester. The reason I\u2019m talking about that game is that absolutely nothing is happening in this one. 14 min Palace are having an even share of possession now, although the best thing about the game remains the two kits. 11 min Ayew and Schlupp combine promisingly on the left of the West Ham box before Yarmolenko clears. It hasn\u2019t been a great start to the game. 7 min Palace\u2019s 4-3-2-1 is more of a 45---1 at the moment. Wilfried Zaha must be loving his role on the right wing. 5 min Nothing to report as yet. Palace are defending very deep, as you\u2019d expect. 2 min The pattern of the match has been set, with lots of West Ham possession. Find someone who loves you as much as Roy Hodgson loves good defensive shape. 1 min Peep peep! Crystal Palace kick off from right to left. There are two cracking kits on show today: West Ham\u2019s 1970s homage vs the Palace sash. The players are in the tunnel, and what a spacious, beautifully air-conditioned tunnel it is. Liverpool\u2019s winner means that West Ham will go third if they win tonight. Now that\u2019s an evocative position round these parts. Liverpool have won their 17th consecutive Premier League game. James Milner, so reliable from the spot, has scored at Anfield to give them a 2-1 win over Leicester. It\u2019s surely going to happen this year. Liverpool have an injury-time penalty at Anfield... James Maddison has equalised for Leicester in a fascinating match at Anfield. Follow the last 10 minutes with Will Unwin. West Ham (4-1-4-1) Roberto; Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell; Rice; Yarmolenko, Noble, Lanzini, Felipe Anderson; Haller. Substitutes: Martin, Balbuena, Zabaleta, Snodgrass, Fornals, Wilshere, Ajeti. Crystal Palace (4-3-2-1) Guaita; Ward, Kelly, Cahill, van Aanholt; Kouyate, McArthur, McCarthy; Zaha, Schlupp; Ayew. Substitutes: Hennessey, Tomkins, Dann, Camarasa, Meyer, Townsend, Benteke. Referee Michael Oliver. Hello. For a team that started the season with a 5-0 home defeat, West Ham are going along quite nicely. They are unbeaten since then, fifth in the table and playing some classy football; their last home game was that impressive win over Manchester United. Crystal Palace are quietly having a good season themselves. Their defence has been typically excellent, apart from one shambolic half at Spurs, with only Liverpool and Leicester conceding fewer goals. A win for either side would take them to fourth in the table. Kick off is at 5.30pm.",

      "body": "<p> </p> <p>The newspaper photographer Sally Soames has died at the age of 82. Speaking on Saturday to the Observer, the newspaper that gave Soames her first assignment, her only child, Trevor, said she had died that morning at her home in north London, surrounded by her family and after a long period of illness.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all very upset.

She was self-taught behind the lens, but later received some formal training from the Guardian picture editor, John Pilkington, when she took her first job on the paper. But it was a prize-winning picture of a youth in Trafalgar Square on New Year\u2019s Eve 1960 that landed Soames her first assignment on the Observer in 1963.</p> <p>The photographer later worked for the New York Times, Newsweek and the Sunday Times, joining the staff in 1968 and remaining there until 2000.

      "bodyText": "The newspaper photographer Sally Soames has died at the age of 82. Speaking on Saturday to the Observer, the newspaper that gave Soames her first assignment, her only child, Trevor, said she had died that morning at her home in north London, surrounded by her family and after a long period of illness. \u201cWe are all very upset. She was a beautiful woman,\u201d he said. Many of Soames\u2019s frank and engaging solo portraits of famous people, including well-known shots of Rudolf Nureyev, Chris Eubank, Iris Murdoch and Hilary Mantel, are now held in galleries and collections around the world. The National Portrait Gallery in London has 17 of her images. Soames once said that her photographic hero was Anthony Armstrong Jones, who, like her, preferred to take pictures in black and white using natural light. She was self-taught behind the lens, but later received some formal training from the Guardian picture editor, John Pilkington, when she took her first job on the paper. But it was a prize-winning picture of a youth in Trafalgar Square on New Year\u2019s Eve 1960 that landed Soames her first assignment on the Observer in 1963. The photographer later worked for the New York Times, Newsweek and the Sunday Times, joining the staff in 1968 and remaining there until 2000. Early retirement was forced upon her by physical difficulties which, according to her son, were brought on by years of carrying heavy camera equipment and struggling to get a good view of the events she covered. \u201cShe was very petite and she was always trying to get an unusual angle, from down on the floor or something, and eventually her body gave in. And of course her retirement also coincided with the arrival of colour film. She refused to take colour pictures,\u201d he said. Born in London as Sally Winkleman, the photographer was an aunt to the Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman. Among her other key portraits are studies of Margaret Thatcher, Seamus Heaney and Tony Blair, the latter taken during the 2001 election campaign. Her arresting image of Andy Warhol was photographed through a pane of glass. Soames\u2019s books of portraits include Manpower (1987) and Writers (1995) and she prided herself on the research she carried out, often exchanging letters before meeting her subjects. \u201cI used to talk to them,\u201d she once said. \u201cNowadays you don\u2019t have the time with people \u2013 everything\u2019s changed and PR people are timing you; it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d Soames also told how, later in her career, she was scheduled just three-and-a-half minutes to photograph Sean Connery in a luxury hotel. She spent two of those minutes talking to him. A pioneering woman in a male field, when Soames arrived to photograph Cassius Clay in 1966, before he became Muhammad Ali, the boxer said he had never met a female photographer before. Soames gifted the bulk of her work to the Guardian Media Group\u2019s Scott Trust Foundation. She said she believed that she was at her best when she started because she was \u201cfearless\u201d. \u201cIn latter years I was more professional, a bit institutionalised,\u201d she argued.",

According to the Washington Post, Trump \u201charangued\u201d May about Britain\u2019s contribution to Nato in a phone call with Britain\u2019s then prime minister in the summer of last year, before disputing Russian involvement in the Skripal case. \u201cTrump totally bought into the idea there was credible doubt about the poisoning,\u201d said a figure briefed on the call. \u201cA solid 10 minutes of the conversation is spent with May saying it\u2019s highly likely and him saying he\u2019s not sure.\u201d The Skripals were left fighting for their lives after the novichok attack in Salisbury, while a policeman was also left seriously ill. A second policeman was recently discovered to have been injured in the attack. Two Russian agents, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, were identified as the likely culprits. However, they later appeared on Russia\u2019s state-funded TV station RT, claiming they visited the \u201cwonderful\u201d English city as tourists to see its cathedral. Trump has been pursued over his relationship with Russia ever since allegations emerged that the country colluded with the Trump presidential campaign in 2016. The Robert Mueller report, which examined the claims, concluded Russia had been attempting to swing the presidential election in favour of Trump, but did not say whether there had been collusion. Stephen Gethins, a Scottish National party member of the foreign affairs select committee, said: \u201cThe evidence of Russian involvement in the poisoning of Mr Skripal and his daughter is overwhelming. It was an appalling chemical weapons attack that should horrify us all. \u201cWhat is just as worrying is that Boris Johnson wants to align the UK closer to Donald Trump with his discredited foreign policy. Our closest foreign policy partners are and should remain those in the EU. We need to work with our partners in Europe to stand up to Putin\u2019s bullying of Russia\u2019s neighbours as well as attacks on human rights and democracy activists domestically.\u201d At the time of the Skripal poisoning, Jeremy Corbyn caused a backlash among his own MPs after appearing to question the evidence that Moscow was behind the Salisbury attack. Corbyn warned that the government should not be \u201crushing way ahead of the evidence\u201d over the poisoning and warned of a drift towards a \u201cnew cold war\u201d with Russia.",

Henderson rushed out to the edge of the area to save the striker\u2019s shot. Henderson rescued his team again in stoppage time, blocking a header by Dawson from Gerard Deulofeu\u2019s free-kick. It was a fine way for the goalkeeper to reassert his quality after the mistake that led to defeat against Liverpool last week. \u201cThese things happen in football and in life and it\u2019s how you react and overcome the next hurdle,\u201d said United\u2019s manager, Chris Wilder. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to us how he\u2019s done it. He\u2019s come roaring back.\u201d",

A fifth person, also part of the administration team, was gravely injured. The investigation into the \u201cmurder and attempted murder of public agents\u201d in connections with a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d has been handed over to the anti-terrorist brigade.</p> <p>Ricard said the attacker had arrived for work at the police headquarters at 8.58am on Thursday after taking the suburban train near his home in the north-west suburb of Gonesse. At 12.18pm he left the police complex on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9.</p> <p>\u201cHe went to a shop in the Rue Saint-Jacques and bought two knives. One was a metal kitchen knife 33cm long with a 20cm blade, the other was an oyster knife. Leaving the shop he took a detour and hid the knives he had bought on him,\u201d Ricard told a press conference. He said the attacker\u2019s behaviour during this time \u201cdisplayed no nervousness\u201d.</p> <p>After Micka\u00ebl H returned to his office, Ricard described how \u201cin circumstances to be established \u2026 he mortally wounded with his knife, two victims who were getting ready to go to lunch\u201d. He said that the first victim, a 50-year-old, suffered a large wound to the neck, a second, aged 38, was fatally stabbed several times around the thorax and abdomen.</p> <p>\u201cThe autopsies carried out after these deaths show that it was a scene of extreme violence,\u201d he added. \u201cThe attacker then went to another office on the same floor and stabbed a 37-year-old agent several times, two of them fatal. He then tried to go into another office, luckily closed, in which three police staff were having their lunch.\u201d</p> <p>The attacker then took the stairs and stabbed a 39-year-old police officer, who died of their wounds. At the ground level he attacked a member of the administrative staff, leaving them with serious but non-fatal wounds to the neck.</p> <p>In the prefecture courtyard, he was challenged by a trainee police officer who tried to reason with him telling him to drop his knife. He told police that the man ignored his appeals and ran at him with the knife, so he shot him twice. \u201cThe total length of this killing spree is estimated at seven minutes,\u201d Ricard said.</p> <p>Ricard said Mikha\u00ebl H was 45 and had been born on the French island of Martinique, adding he had been left deaf after suffering with meningitis. He had converted to Islam several years ago, according to witnesses.</p> <p>He joined the police in 2003, and worked as a computer expert with the surveillance department. He had no criminal record but appeared in court on charges of domestic violence in 2009. \u201cWe are now looking into motives and accomplices to this attack,\u201d Richard said.</p> <p>He said Mikha\u00ebl H and his wife, 38, who is being questioned by police as a suspected accomplice, exchanged 33 SMS messages between 11.21am and 11.50am on Thursday. He said the subject matter of these messages were \u201cexclusively religious\u201d and ended with the words: \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and \u201cFollow our beloved prophet Mohamed and reflect on the Qur\u2019an\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese SMS, if not explicit about any possible attack, nevertheless were sent only 30 minutes before the knives were bought,\u201d Ricard said. He added the attacker was believed to have been in contact with others thought to belong to \u201ca Salafist movement\u201d.</p> <p>Witnesses have told police the attacker showed signs of radicalisation, notably expressing support for Islamist actions, his reluctance to have contact with women, justification of the 2015 attack on the satirical newspaper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo\">Charlie Hebdo</a> and changing his dress several months ago from \u201cwestern clothing to that suitable for the mosque\u201d.</p> <p>Ricard said the investigation had become one for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/04/anti-terror-police-take-over-paris-knife-attack-case\">anti-terrorist investigators</a> because of \u201ca combination of elements \u2026 the premeditated character of the attack, his professed desire to die during the attack, the nature of the attacks and the injuries inflicted on at least one of the victims, the context of latent radicalisation and the exclusively religious message sent before the attack\u201d.</p>",

Ricard said the attacker had arrived for work at the police headquarters at 8.58am on Thursday after taking the suburban train near his home in the north-west suburb of Gonesse. At 12.18pm he left the police complex on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. \u201cHe went to a shop in the Rue Saint-Jacques and bought two knives. One was a metal kitchen knife 33cm long with a 20cm blade, the other was an oyster knife. Leaving the shop he took a detour and hid the knives he had bought on him,\u201d Ricard told a press conference. He said the attacker\u2019s behaviour during this time \u201cdisplayed no nervousness\u201d. After Micka\u00ebl H returned to his office, Ricard described how \u201cin circumstances to be established \u2026 he mortally wounded with his knife, two victims who were getting ready to go to lunch\u201d. He said that the first victim, a 50-year-old, suffered a large wound to the neck, a second, aged 38, was fatally stabbed several times around the thorax and abdomen. \u201cThe autopsies carried out after these deaths show that it was a scene of extreme violence,\u201d he added. \u201cThe attacker then went to another office on the same floor and stabbed a 37-year-old agent several times, two of them fatal. He then tried to go into another office, luckily closed, in which three police staff were having their lunch.\u201d The attacker then took the stairs and stabbed a 39-year-old police officer, who died of their wounds. At the ground level he attacked a member of the administrative staff, leaving them with serious but non-fatal wounds to the neck. In the prefecture courtyard, he was challenged by a trainee police officer who tried to reason with him telling him to drop his knife. He told police that the man ignored his appeals and ran at him with the knife, so he shot him twice. \u201cThe total length of this killing spree is estimated at seven minutes,\u201d Ricard said. Ricard said Mikha\u00ebl H was 45 and had been born on the French island of Martinique, adding he had been left deaf after suffering with meningitis. He had converted to Islam several years ago, according to witnesses. He joined the police in 2003, and worked as a computer expert with the surveillance department. He had no criminal record but appeared in court on charges of domestic violence in 2009. \u201cWe are now looking into motives and accomplices to this attack,\u201d Richard said. He said Mikha\u00ebl H and his wife, 38, who is being questioned by police as a suspected accomplice, exchanged 33 SMS messages between 11.21am and 11.50am on Thursday. He said the subject matter of these messages were \u201cexclusively religious\u201d and ended with the words: \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and \u201cFollow our beloved prophet Mohamed and reflect on the Qur\u2019an\u201d. \u201cThese SMS, if not explicit about any possible attack, nevertheless were sent only 30 minutes before the knives were bought,\u201d Ricard said. He added the attacker was believed to have been in contact with others thought to belong to \u201ca Salafist movement\u201d. Witnesses have told police the attacker showed signs of radicalisation, notably expressing support for Islamist actions, his reluctance to have contact with women, justification of the 2015 attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and changing his dress several months ago from \u201cwestern clothing to that suitable for the mosque\u201d. Ricard said the investigation had become one for anti-terrorist investigators because of \u201ca combination of elements \u2026 the premeditated character of the attack, his professed desire to die during the attack, the nature of the attacks and the injuries inflicted on at least one of the victims, the context of latent radicalisation and the exclusively religious message sent before the attack\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Ed Needham is the editor of <a href=\"http://strong-words.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Strong Words,</em></a> a magazine about books that he writes and edits on his own from his flat in Camden Town, a feat that has impressed novelists such as Sebastian Faulks and Elizabeth Day. A former editor of several magazines, including <em>Rolling Stone,</em> he is a champion of books, from graphic novels to literary fiction, biographies to investigative works.</p> <p><strong>When and why did you set up <em>Strong Words?</em></strong><br>It\u2019s been going for about 18 months. I did it because the world pulled the rug out from beneath the magazine industry when advertising migrated to digital. The chances of getting another editor\u2019s job at the level I was used to had vanished. I don\u2019t know how to do anything else. I can\u2019t operate a crane or crack a safe. So I thought, what can I do? Just as the technology has come along that enables people to make high-quality magazines with tiny teams, that same technology has destroyed the market. But there\u2019s quite a lot of activity in independent publishing and niche markets. I realised that as long as I keep costs down, I don\u2019t need to sell many copies for it to be a viable business.</p> <p><strong>You write and edit </strong><strong>the magazine</strong><strong> \u2013 </strong><strong>about 30,000 words an issue</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you </strong><strong>read the books reviewed. How do you organise your working week?</strong><br>It\u2019s not as if those 30,000 words require the sophistication or structure of a novel \u2013 it works to quite a regular format. I just need to set myself a deadline each day. I work seven days a week, starting at 6am. I spend the first couple of hours walking and listening to audiobooks, and finish at about six in the evening.</p> <p><strong>There are impressive names like</strong><strong> Sebastian Faulks who\u2019ve come out in support of <em>Strong Words</em>. What\u2019s been the general response of the literary and publishing worlds?</strong><br>Hugely encouraging. The publishing industry is seeing a lot of its press square footage vanish. Many newspapers and magazines are no longer motivated to run a lot of stuff about books and authors, because there\u2019s no advertising upside. </p> <p><strong>What was it like editing <em>Rolling Stone </em>magazine?</strong><br>It was over 15 years ago \u2013 I\u2019d been working in New York for a number of years, but coming from an English magazine background, where you have a small staff and have to graft to get stars to talk to you, it was still a revelation. At <em>Rolling Stone,</em> even the biggest names would stop whatever they were doing to be on the cover. Back then, Jann [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/14/jann-wenner-rolling-stone-founder-interview-hunter-s-thompson-john-lennon\" title=\"\">Wenner, founder of <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>] was right at the top of the political and social world, amazingly well connected, and knew how everything worked. I\u2019d been brought in to shake things up but Jann liked keeping a firm grip on his own magazine, so it was like two people trying to do one person\u2019s job and I eventually moved on.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the last </strong><strong>great book you read?</strong><br>I love the Lisa Taddeo book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/27/three-women-lisa-taddeo-review\" title=\"\"><em>Three Women</em></a>. She moved house and spent eight years immersing herself in other people\u2019s lives. That shows an extraordinary commitment. And the other book I\u2019ve enjoyed lately is Robert Caro\u2019s mini-memoir <em>Working,</em> which is a collection of things he\u2019s written about how he does his work. There\u2019s fantastic stuff in there about how, when he decides to start writing about Lyndon Johnson, he goes to the <a href=\"http://www.lbjlibrary.org/\" title=\"\">LBJ Library</a> and discovers that there are 32m pages of archives.</p> <p><strong>What kind of books do you read for </strong><strong>pleasure?</strong><br>True crime \u2013 I like to hear what the mafia have been doing lately. And I like stories of fraud and financial shenanigans. I can never get enough of the financial crisis. I\u2019m reading a fantastic book at the moment called <em>Billion Dollar Whale </em>about a Malaysian guy who allegedly milks his own country\u2019s exchequer for $7bn and then blows it all on vulgarities.</p> <p><strong>Which books do you feel are most overrated?</strong><br>I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever say any book is overrated because I always assume I\u2019m the one who\u2019s got the problem. But I have to say, I felt I gave just about everything I had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/henryjames\" title=\"\">Henry James</a>, but found it a very unrewarding experience. Also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/elena-ferrante\" title=\"\">Elena Ferrante \u2013</a> I\u2019m not sure that her characters were particularly keen to spend much time with me. That relationship didn\u2019t really last very long, ended badly and I don\u2019t think we will be seeing each other again.</p> <p><strong>Which classic novel are you most ashamed not to have read?</strong><br>Having read <em>Emma </em>at O-level, I\u2019ve never been back to Jane Austen. I\u2019ve got nothing against her. I would like to add a bit more of her stuff to my reading portfolio. Also I would really like to have read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/solzhenitsyn\" title=\"\">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s</a> <em>The Gulag Archipelago. </em>No country holds the gaze quite like Russia does. I think it might be one for the audio book.</p> <p><strong>Is there a book or author to which you often return?</strong><br>Returning is not really an option any more, given that there are so many books published. But if there were someone whose books I\u2019d like to give a second spin, it would be Charles Dickens, who I enjoyed as a teenager, and Michael Lewis.</p> <p><strong>Who is your favourite literary protagonist?</strong><br>This is a slightly emergency answer, but I think perhaps Patrick Melrose, for his fabulous turn of phrase and his attitude towards his quite appalling family \u2013 both qualities I have a good deal of time for.</p> <p><strong>What book would you give to a young person?</strong><br>As children are so overexposed to talking animals and general anthropomorphism, I think I would give them either <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/james-herbert\" title=\"\">James Herbert\u2019s</a> <em>The Rats </em>or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/23/art-spiegelman-maus-25th-anniversary\" title=\"\">Art Spiegelman\u2019s</a> <em>Maus </em>just to let them know the animal kingdom is not quite what they\u2019ve been led to believe thus far.</p> <p><strong>What do you plan to read next?</strong><br>I\u2019ve got a book lined up called <em>The Man Who Played </em><em>With Fire </em>by Jan Stocklassa, who has written about the novelist Stieg Larsson\u2019s attempt to get to the bottom of the Olaf Palme assassination, which looks fantastic. It only takes a book on a subject to come along, and within two pages you realise you don\u2019t know anything. Between what I\u2019ve forgotten and the things that books have reminded me I\u2019ve got completely wrong, it\u2019s amazing that I can put my shoes on the right way.</p> <p><em>Strong Words is available from </em><a href=\"http://strong-words.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>strong-words.co.uk</em></a><em>, or WHSmith</em></p>",

But there\u2019s quite a lot of activity in independent publishing and niche markets. I realised that as long as I keep costs down, I don\u2019t need to sell many copies for it to be a viable business. You write and edit the magazine \u2013 about 30,000 words an issue; you read the books reviewed. How do you organise your working week? It\u2019s not as if those 30,000 words require the sophistication or structure of a novel \u2013 it works to quite a regular format. I just need to set myself a deadline each day. I work seven days a week, starting at 6am. I spend the first couple of hours walking and listening to audiobooks, and finish at about six in the evening. There are impressive names like Sebastian Faulks who\u2019ve come out in support of Strong Words. What\u2019s been the general response of the literary and publishing worlds? Hugely encouraging. The publishing industry is seeing a lot of its press square footage vanish. Many newspapers and magazines are no longer motivated to run a lot of stuff about books and authors, because there\u2019s no advertising upside. What was it like editing Rolling Stone magazine? It was over 15 years ago \u2013 I\u2019d been working in New York for a number of years, but coming from an English magazine background, where you have a small staff and have to graft to get stars to talk to you, it was still a revelation. At Rolling Stone, even the biggest names would stop whatever they were doing to be on the cover. Back then, Jann [Wenner, founder of Rolling Stone] was right at the top of the political and social world, amazingly well connected, and knew how everything worked. I\u2019d been brought in to shake things up but Jann liked keeping a firm grip on his own magazine, so it was like two people trying to do one person\u2019s job and I eventually moved on. What\u2019s the last great book you read? I love the Lisa Taddeo book, Three Women. She moved house and spent eight years immersing herself in other people\u2019s lives. That shows an extraordinary commitment. And the other book I\u2019ve enjoyed lately is Robert Caro\u2019s mini-memoir Working, which is a collection of things he\u2019s written about how he does his work. There\u2019s fantastic stuff in there about how, when he decides to start writing about Lyndon Johnson, he goes to the LBJ Library and discovers that there are 32m pages of archives. What kind of books do you read for pleasure? True crime \u2013 I like to hear what the mafia have been doing lately. And I like stories of fraud and financial shenanigans. I can never get enough of the financial crisis. I\u2019m reading a fantastic book at the moment called Billion Dollar Whale about a Malaysian guy who allegedly milks his own country\u2019s exchequer for $7bn and then blows it all on vulgarities. Which books do you feel are most overrated? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever say any book is overrated because I always assume I\u2019m the one who\u2019s got the problem. But I have to say, I felt I gave just about everything I had to Henry James, but found it a very unrewarding experience. Also Elena Ferrante \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that her characters were particularly keen to spend much time with me. That relationship didn\u2019t really last very long, ended badly and I don\u2019t think we will be seeing each other again. Which classic novel are you most ashamed not to have read? Having read Emma at O-level, I\u2019ve never been back to Jane Austen. I\u2019ve got nothing against her. I would like to add a bit more of her stuff to my reading portfolio. Also I would really like to have read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s The Gulag Archipelago. No country holds the gaze quite like Russia does. I think it might be one for the audio book. Is there a book or author to which you often return? Returning is not really an option any more, given that there are so many books published. But if there were someone whose books I\u2019d like to give a second spin, it would be Charles Dickens, who I enjoyed as a teenager, and Michael Lewis. Who is your favourite literary protagonist? This is a slightly emergency answer, but I think perhaps Patrick Melrose, for his fabulous turn of phrase and his attitude towards his quite appalling family \u2013 both qualities I have a good deal of time for. What book would you give to a young person? As children are so overexposed to talking animals and general anthropomorphism, I think I would give them either James Herbert\u2019s The Rats or Art Spiegelman\u2019s Maus just to let them know the animal kingdom is not quite what they\u2019ve been led to believe thus far. What do you plan to read next? I\u2019ve got a book lined up called The Man Who Played With Fire by Jan Stocklassa, who has written about the novelist Stieg Larsson\u2019s attempt to get to the bottom of the Olaf Palme assassination, which looks fantastic. It only takes a book on a subject to come along, and within two pages you realise you don\u2019t know anything. Between what I\u2019ve forgotten and the things that books have reminded me I\u2019ve got completely wrong, it\u2019s amazing that I can put my shoes on the right way.

It largely ignores them now. Remain campaigners have done their market research and pass over their plight because they know there is little public sympathy. The majority no more had the chance to vote in a referendum that directly affected their prospects than Europeans in Britain did. To top it all, they have been abandoned by nationalists who once supported them. The argument for Brexit was accompanied by the fantasy that Britain could compensate for the loss of access to its largest market by joining the reassuringly white and English-speaking \u201cAnglosphere\u201d of Australia, Canada, the US and New Zealand. This is why they talk of an \u201cAustralian-style points system\u201d and \u201cCanada-style trade deals\u201d and hope against all evidence that the protectionist Donald Trump will rescue Britain. Brexit has shown that you have to be the right type of Anglo to be admitted to the Anglosphere, and Anglos in Europe need not apply. They are stereotyped as pensioners on the Costa del Sol, when 80% are of working age, transformed into citizens of nowhere, flitting between the banks of Frankfurt and Paris. I will spare you the gags about the hypocrisy of rightwing movements, which emit gammony belches about the absurdities of identity politics while creating a nationalist identity politics of their own. The gags write themselves and, in any case, aren\u2019t funny. Better to understand the connections between the minorities and the majority and realise that what happens to them could happen to you. Migrants in Europe and Britain feel a sense of betrayal that ought to be familiar. They have lost a certain idea of Britain as a moderate, tolerant country that did not allow political fakes and flakes to lead it off on mad ideological projects, a sentiment you may share. From 2016, they\u2019ve been told not to worry because \u201cit\u2019ll be fine\u201d. As events have turned out, Europeans must apply for settled status in Britain and place their lives in the hands of the Home Office, one of the worst-run departments in Whitehall. Imagine that the Home Office has a 90% success rate in tracking down all who are legally entitled to stay \u2013 no one believes it will, but imagine. There will still be 320,000 Europeans waiting to be caught in the next Windrush scandal. Boris Johnson said that Europeans could have \u201cabsolute certainty\u201d he would honour Vote Leave\u2019s promises to protect them. Already his government is denying full rights to 42% of applicants. British people in Europe, meanwhile, have no certainty about whether they will have freedom of movement within the EU or the right to return to Britain with their families. Nothing has been settled. Nothing is fine for them or the rest of us. Ireland barely featured in the referendum campaign. The failure of Westminster politics and journalism to face the border question was not accidental. Vote Leave\u2019s Theresa Villiers led a propaganda campaign that assured voters that concerns over border controls in Ireland were \u201cscaremongering\u201d. It\u2019ll be fine. Were you worried about how we leave the EU without hurting the economy? You should not have been. Supporters of Brexit swore the task of striking a free-trade agreement with the EU should be \u201cone of the easiest in human history\u201d. It would be fine. We were told ad nauseam that EU rights for workers and environmental protections would stay in place. They would be fine. Now Johnson\u2019s government says destroying them is \u201cvital for giving us the freedom and flexibility to strike new trade deals and become more competitive\u201d. For years, I\u2019ve believed it is worth watching how a state treats foreigners under its control because you see how it will treat the rest of the population if it has the chance. As rights go, horizons narrow and the culture turns rancid, the identity politics that Brexit Britain is forcing on Europeans is becoming the politics it will force on everyone else. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

Not befitting this game. Awful. Mane wanted to fall more than he wanted the ball, and that will always be a weak point in the English game. English and PL players want to mimic the continent, and mimicry will not get them to a cup. This is a Senegalese player but it\u2019s symptomatic of the English game. As long as the reward for soft fouls is scored at a much higher percentage than when players actually have the ball in the box, they\u2019ll always go down easily. It is the biggest problem with the game. Can you imagine a rugby or American football coach exhorting his player to induce the opposition into making a penalty rather than actually making a play?

      "bodyText": "One for luck: the Football League review: That\u2019s about it. It\u2019s currently 0-0 in West Ham v Crystal Palace, which you can follow with Rob Smyth. Thanks for your company. Reaction arrives from the south coast after Tottenham\u2019s dire 3-0 defeat at Brighton: Mauricio Pochettino said his team struggled to recover from the early blow of a serious injury to Hugo Lloris: \u201cOf course. We cannot lie,\u201d the manager said. \u201cTo concede after two minutes then lose our captain was massive for the team. It was an emotional game. The team was affected, we started to play but never showed our real performance. I don\u2019t want to take credit from Brighton but of course the team suffered a massive impact.\u201d Hope for Nathan Jones? Either way, this was big for Stoke, winning 2-1 in dramatic scenes at Swansea: Sid Lowe was at the Bernab\u00e9u to see Real Madrid 4-2 Granada: It was a bad day for Norwich. A good one for Aston Villa: Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s Watford 0-0 Sheffield United report: A point is a point is a point, so this match was not a complete waste of time, except perhaps for the spectators. Having said that, those who turned up at Vicarage Road can at least say they witnessed one of the misses of the season thanks to Andre Gray. Danny Welbeck and Craig Dawson also had good opportunities but were denied by Dean Henderson, but do not let those facts kid you into thinking Watford were unlucky not to claim their first win of the season. This dreadful game at least ended with a fair result. Nerves of steel ... The big game of the day ... Some very interesting results in the Bundesliga today ... Here is Andy Hunter\u2019s report from Burnley v Everton ... League Two ... League One ... Championship results ... Morgan Dodd gives his view: \u201cSuch a cheap penalty in Liverpool. Not befitting this game. Awful. Mane wanted to fall more than he wanted the ball, and that will always be a weak point in the English game. English and PL players want to mimic the continent, and mimicry will not get them to a cup. This is a Senegalese player but it\u2019s symptomatic of the English game. As long as the reward for soft fouls is scored at a much higher percentage than when players actually have the ball in the box, they\u2019ll always go down easily. It is the biggest problem with the game. Can you imagine a rugby or American football coach exhorting his player to induce the opposition into making a penalty rather than actually making a play? It would be laughable.\u201d Jolly knows ... Robertson seems to be ushering Perez down the tunnel where they can sorted things out, one way or another. Perez was actually wanting to kill Robertson. Hopefully they\u2019ll settle their differences. Burnley 1-0 Everton Liverpool 2-1 Leicester Norwich 1-5 Aston Villa Watford 0-0 Sheffield United The less said the better. Coleman\u2019s dismissal and Everton\u2019s zonal marking costs them at Turf Moor. Perez wants to kill someone in a Liverpool shirt. I think it was Milner ... An emphatic victory for Aston Villa for Norwich. Well ... it looked like Liverpool would be dropping their first points of the season but instead a late penalty means they are now going to be eight points clear at the top. Milner keeps his cool. Liverpool\u2019s winning run continues. PENALTY TO LIVERPOOL IN THE 93RD MINUTE!! Mane was felled in the box. Goal! Swansea 1-2 Stoke (Hogan, 90) Jones thought he was done for as Stoke manager but Hogan has popped up in the last minute to almost certainly earn them a win. Mary Waltz thinks the Maddison goal was not just big this afternoon, she says: \u201cThe Foxes have just changed this title race from a two team battle to a three way challenge. This is no one off fluke. Rodgers has a fine squad that will challenge the two giants the rest of the way.\u201d Kevin Harrington asks: \u201cAnyone out there that can score a goal for Everton?\u201d No. Mings sends a poor header back to Heaton but it doesn\u2019t have enough on it, allowing Drmic to nip in to score. A nice consolation, I guess. Watford versus Sheffield United sounds utterly dreadful. Last on Match of the Day, one thinks. Van Dijk heads over the bar from a corner despite being unmarked just 10 yards out. He looks pretty gutted to miss from that position. Sub Douglas Luiz bends the ball into the top corner to make the win officially emphatic. GOAL! Crewe 1-1 Exeter (Anene, 76) The battle at the top of League Two is level after Anene nets for Crewe. He used to play with Arshavin in Kazakhstan, so he\u2019s certainly well travelled. Perez does the work on the edge of the box for Leicester before slipping the ball to Maddison who makes sufficient space before nestling his shot into the corner. QPR 4-1 Blackburn (Hugill, 77), Preston 5-1 Barnsley (Harrop, 77) GOALS GOAL GOALS. Huddersfield 2-0 Hull (Bacuna, 74) The Cowley revolution is in full flow as Bacuna doubles the Terriers\u2019 lead. Goal! West Brom 3-0 Cardiff (Austin, 71) Game over at The Hawthorns where Austin has got the wrong side of the defence and whacked one beyond Smithies. Rod Wooden points out: \u201cWill, it\u2019s maybe worth mentioning that Norwich are playing with the equivalent of a whole team of players out injured, the third string goalkeeper, no holding midfielders and two academy players on the bench to make up the numbers.\u201d A deep corner to the back post finds its way to Hendrick who volleys the ball home while unmarked. That was far too easy for the Clarets against 10 men. Goal! Derby 2-0 Luton (Lawrence, 70) For legal reasons, all I can say is that Tom Lawrence has scored today. Prince George is at Norwich supporting his father\u2019s beloved Aston Villa. He must think it\u2019s always like this as a Villa fan. Cambridge 1-2 Macclesfield (Gnahoua, 68) Down in League Two Macclesfield have turned things around at the Abbey Stadium through Archibald and now Gnahoua. Can someone please check on Max Rushden? Liverpool almost double their lead as Robertson is played through but the defender\u2019s shot is repelled by Schmeichel to keep Leicester in the match. Stop getting sent off, lads Fleetwood 0-1 Ipswich (Jackson, 59) League One leaders Ipswich are ahead in Lancashire thanks to Kayden Jackson\u2019s strike. They could start to pull away at the top in the third tier. Buendia is caught in possession just outside his own box and Hourihane is the one who makes the most of the situation by whacking one into the corner. A pretty desperate day for Norwich. Goal! Nottingham Forest 1-0 Brentford (Watson, 56) In-form Forest are ahead after Watson half volleys a Lolley corner into the net. Could this be Forest\u2019s year? Seamus Coleman collects his second yellow card for a clash with Dwight McNeil. Advantage Burnley. Leicester\u2019s centre-back were always in for a tough day and Soyuncu goes into the book at Liverpool after pulling back Salah. He can enjoy walking a tight rope for the remainder of the fixture. Charlie Mentern has a challenge for you: \u201cWhilst checking the Swindon Town vs Bradford City score on Saturday, I noticed three Bradford players named began with the O\u2019, one being O\u2019Donnell and the other two O\u2019Connor. Has a team had more than three? Surely an Irish team can beat this?\u201d Peter Oh asks: \u201cDid anyone record Brendan Rodgers\u2019 halftime talk in the Anfield visitors\u2019 dressing room? I imagine him - in an effort to outdo the RB Salzburg manager midweek - switching seamlessly from plain English to managementspeak to Spanish and back.\u201d Would be worthwhile viewing. We\u2019ll have to see if such methods worked ... Norwich give the ball away in the middle of the park, allow El Ghazi to capitalise before Grealish finishes off the move and, ultimately, the game. Whistles have blown across the country, so goals will almost certainly be flying in soon. In this marathon relay that Clockwatch has become today, Luke has departed to be replace by yours truly for all the second half action up and down the country (plus some other places). Championship scores ... See all the half-time scores right here! Barnsley grabbed an equaliser at Preston just before half-time, their first away goal of the league campaign. It\u2019s 1-1 there: The scores on the Premier League doors: Goal! Real Madrid 2-0 Granada (Eden Hazard 45). A charming little dink when one-on-one with the goalkeeper, and the ex-Chelsea man has his first Real Madrid goal, in first-half stoppage time at the Bernab\u00e9u. Goal! Millwall 2-0 Leeds (Tom Bradshaw 45). Leeds rallied impressively after going a man and a goal down early on, and had the best of it for a while, but now they\u2019re losing 2-0. Here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s report after England Lionesses\u2019 2-1 defeat at the hands of Brazil at Riverside Stadium: Goal! West Brom 2-0 Cardiff City (Grady Diangana 42) Klopp\u2019s men take the lead! The move starts with Virgil van Dijk in Liverpool\u2019s penalty area. The ball is worked out to the left, and James Milner curls a delightful long pass into the path of Man\u00e9, who tucks the ball away when one-on-one with Kasper Schmeichel. Over in Spain, Real Madrid lead Granada 1-0, scored by Karim Benzema after just two minutes. In Germany it\u2019s 0-0 between Bayern Munich and Hoffenheim with 55 minutes played. Wesley misses out on his hat-trick! Norwich\u2019s third-choice gloveman keeps out Wesley\u2019s penalty and then the striker blasts the rebound over. Goal! MK Dons 0-1 Burton (Liam Boyce 32) Goal! Preston 1-0 Barnsley (Daniel Johnson 31). After some good work by the wily veteran forward David Nugent, Johnson loops a header into the far corner, and Preston are ahead at Deepdale. Goal! AFC Wimbledon 3-0 Rochdale (Mitch Pinnock 28). Wimbledon have flown out of the blocks at Kingsmeadow, AKA The Cherry Red Records Stadium. It\u2019s a double for the Villa striker! They are all over Norwich City like a rash, or a cheap suit, or something. Grealish starts a move down the left, Targett finds Hourihane charging to the by-line, and his excellent cutback finds Wesley who directs the ball in from six yards out. The Canaries are in big trouble. In the Scottish Premiership, Ross County lead St. Johnstone 1-0, the goal coming from Joseph Chalmers after 10 minutes. The other three Scottish top-flight games are currently goalless. Goal! Swansea 1-1 Stoke (Sam Clucas 22). Stoke back level! Clucas pounces after a Joe Allen shot is saved by Freddie Woodman, and it\u2019s all square at the Liberty Stadium. Goal! West Brom 1-0 Cardiff (Matheus Pereira 20) Goal! Plymouth 1-1 Scunthorpe (Will Ainson 20). The goals are quite literally flying in around the leagues. And there\u2019s the latest one from League Two. Goal! Rotherham 2-0 Coventry City (Michael Smith pen 19) Goal! Millwall 1-0 Leeds (Jed Wallace pen 16). Gaetano Berardi gets a straight red, and 10-man Leeds immediately find themselves a goal down in south London. A slightly scuffed finish on the turn by the Villa striker, right footed, after he controls El Ghazi\u2019s cross from the right. Goalkeeper Michael McGovern rushed off his line but was helpless to stop the shot. It was a nice move by Villa and they open their account at Carrow Road! Goal! Derby 1-0 Luton (Matthew Pearson OG 11) This is a real howler for the Hatters, goalie Simon Sluga missing a back pass from the right entirely. It goes down as a Pearson OG, but it\u2019s entirely the fault of the goalkeeper. Andre Gray has just missed an early sitter for Watford against Sheffield United, and at Anfield, Liverpool are having very much the best of it against Leicester City. All the 3pms in the Premier League still goalless. Goal! AFC Wimbledon 1-0 Rochdale (Marcus Forss 2) In League One, AFC Wimbledon take the lead against Rochdale, while League Two leaders Exeter have gone in front at Crewe, Dean Moxey getting the goal. Goal! Swansea 1-0 Stoke (Andre Ayew 1). Appalling start to the day for Stoke City - Ayew follows up like all good strikers do, and scores on the rebound for the Swans, after an initial shot by Yan Dhanda. The four 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League are getting under way as I type. Meanwhile, here is Barney Ronay\u2019s report from Brighton\u2019s 3-0 home win against Spurs: Liverpool boss J\u00fcrgen Klopp talks: \u201cIf you want to be in top spot in this league, you have to deliver week-in, week-out, or in fact, every three days. That\u2019s our job.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see Lovren catching Vardy,\u201d says Paul Merson on Sky Sports, assessing Liverpool\u2019s chances of containing a very potent Leicester City attack, with creative lynchpin James Maddison back in the Foxes side. \u201cThat\u2019s an easy out-ball for them [Leicester] down that channel.\u201d Women\u2019s international friendly: Bethany England came off the bench to score and keep things interesting for the final 10 minutes at the Riverside Stadium, but Brazil prevailed in the end. Premier League: Things go from bad to worse for Tottenham, as they have their collective backside handed to them by a Brighton team who could have won by more. Aaron Connolly stole the headlines, the teenager from Galway scoring two goals in his first Premier League start. Tottenham were as inept as Brighton were outstanding - they are a shambles, lurching from one bad result to the next. They have also lost their goalkeeper and captain, Hugo Lloris, to what looks like a very serious arm injury. Back at the Amex Stadium: Brighton have been quite outstanding in all departments and lead Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 as the game moves into added time. Without wanting to take anything away from Graham Potter and his men, Tottenham have stunk the place out. AS if it were not already painfully obvious to Spurs fans, theirs is not a happy camp. Meanwhile in Middlesbrough England\u2019s Lionesses are entertaining Brazil in a friendly before a packed house at Middlesbrough\u2019s Riverside Stadium, where things are not going very well for Phil Neville\u2019s side. They\u2019re 2-0 down with about 20 minutes to go. Follow the action with Will Unwin ... Norwich: McGovern, Aarons, Amadou, Godfrey, Lewis, Leitner, McLean, Emi, Stiepermann, Cantwell, Pukki. Subs: Byram, Roberts, Drmic, Srbeny, Idah, Famewo, Mair. Aston Villa: Heaton, Guilbert, Engels, Mings, Targett, McGinn, Nakamba, Hourihane, El Ghazi, Wesley, Grealish.

Brighton have been outstanding and are piling the pain on Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cWe want seven!!!\u201d chant the home fans, riffing on the pain inflicted on Spurs by Bayern Munich earlier this week. Follow the final 25 minutes with Rob Smyth ... This just in ... Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has revealed he is considering a job offer from Fifa, but says it would not prevent him from returning to management. The Frenchman has been out of work since May 2018, when he left Arsenal after 22 years in charge. Speaking to beIN Sports, Wenger, 69, confirmed he is considering accepting a role at Fifa after admitting the international governing body must continue to \u201cimprove the rules of the game\u201d. \u201cI just want to share what I\u2019ve learnt and give it back to the game in a different way,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not sure if I would stop coaching as well because the devil is still in there. But I have to see, \u2018do I like it?\u2019 And can I be efficient? \u201cWhat would I be dealing with? Coaching efficiency, after career potential for players and to educate them so they have potential jobs after the career of a football player. \u201cWe forget the drama of a football player is they get to the top and then at 34 years, a young man, and it is then, \u2018bye bye it\u2019s over\u2019. I think there is enough to do there to help the players come back and help to develop football.\u201d Today in the Championship Odin Bailey scored a late winner for Birmingham City as they put Middlesbrough to the sword in last night\u2019s opening game of the weekend. This afternoon, top take on bottom as Swansea City entertain Stoke City at the Liberty Stadium. One of the most expensively assembled squads in the Championship, Stoke are rock bottom of the table and still looking for their first win of the campaign. Meanwhile at the Amex Stadium ... Brighton are entertaining Tottenham Hotspur on the south coast in today\u2019s early fixture and look on course to register only their second Premier League win of the season. They lead 2-0 in the early stages of the second half, having comprehensively outplayed a lethargic Tottenham completely lacking in anything approaching urgency in the opening 45 minutes. Hugo Lloris was at fault for the first goal inside three minutes, misjudging his position as he came to grab a high ball he was subsequently forced to drop upon realising he was about to carry it into his own net. As Neil Maupay headed the bouncing ball home from inches out, Lloris fell awkwardly and sustained a serious arm injury. Screaming with pain between gulps of oxygen, he was given morphine, stretchered off and brought to hospital. Brighton doubled their lead courtesy of young Galway man Aaron Connolly, who fired past Tottenham\u2019s replacement goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga after finding himself unmarked and on the end of a cross from Dan Burn to score on his PRemier League debut. Follow the second half with Rob Smyth ... On paper at least, Liverpool\u2019s match against Leicester is the pick of today\u2019s games, with Brendan Rodgers taking an exciting team that has given every indication they might break into the top four to his old stomping ground of Anfield. It\u2019s one of just four three o\u2019clock kick-offs this afternoon, but we\u2019ll keep you posted on all the main talking points from the Championship and beyond. Stay tuned for team news and build-up.",

In my position I have to accept it, same as it is when we are praised.\u201d For Graham Potter victory brought a sense of the season starting in earnest with a first home win. \u201cYou need luck, which we got with the first goal,\u201d the Brighton manager said. \u201cBut overall I\u2019m really happy with the performance. We defended well, attacked well, and when we made mistakes we recovered.\u201d There was praise for 19-year-old Aaron Connolly, who scored twice. \u201cAaron gave us another dimension because that\u2019s what his qualities are. He wants to run towards goal and he wants to score.\u201d Potter said his team had not practised the move for Connolly\u2019s second goal, a jink in from the left in a manner similar to one of Serge Gnabry\u2019s efforts on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s coincidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to say to our players: \u2018Be Bayern Munich players.\u2019\u201d",

However, whatever you think of the Sussexes\u2019 media complaints, Markle\u2019s treatment has been generally atrocious. She has been slammed as everything from an outsider to a hypocrite to a gold-digger. All that corrosive ugliness about her racial heritage (let\u2019s not pretend <em>that</em> isn\u2019t happening). She even gets stick for being American, as though she\u2019s some woke-reincarnated Wallis Simpson putting the crown in peril.</p> <p>Markle has made some mistakes, mainly in thinking that US-style celebrity could translate easily to British royalty. But, really, big deal. She\u2019s not even the first royal to make that mistake \u2013 look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/sep/27/prince-andrews-damaged-reputation-podcast\" title=\"\">Prince Andrew</a>, who has spent his entire aimless life swanning around (and worse?) by royal appointment.</p> <p>If Markle initially overplayed her hand at being our first Insta-ready royal, then some in the UK made the mistake of routinely debasing her as if she were some trashy reality TV celebrity. No judgment here (I love trashy reality TV celebrities), but they\u2019d be the first to acknowledge that their business model can be heavily reliant on negative attention. At least they get to fight back, unlike Markle. Until now.</p> <p>No wonder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/meghan-sues-mail-on-sunday-for-publishing-letter-to-her-father\" title=\"\">Harry feels the urge</a> to protect her, like he couldn\u2019t his own mother. I imagine this isn\u2019t even about them \u2013 that the key is their son and the atmosphere they want him to grow up in.</p> <p>As for Markle, she arrived with a bounce but these days, even when she\u2019s smiling, there\u2019s anxiety in her eyes.

Male MPs all seem to wear the exact same cheap, depressing suit and no one ever comments. Yet female politicians endure relentless scrutiny for their sartorial choices, with every skirt, shoe and handbag criticised and analysed.</p> <p>The practice is reductive, patronising and\u2026 sorry, but I\u2019m going to have to make an exception.

Her outfit was impossible to ignore and in a way that\u2019s beyond gender. She sported a Burberry \u201ccoat of many colours\u201d that admittedly may one day come in useful for an am-dram production of <em>Joseph and His Amazing Technicolo</em><em>r Dreamcoat</em>, teamed with a short skirt, sheer tights and knee boots.</p> <p>Full disclosure: I once dressed similarly to go to a festival, but at least I had the excuse that it was at the peak of acid house. To employ the vernacular of the era, dare I inquire if Leadsom is \u201con one\u201d? As I say, I would not stoop to analysing her clothes \u2013 wear what you like, girl! Let\u2019s just hope for her sake that this obvious bid to be considered for roles in the forthcoming panto season will be heeded.</p> <p>\u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist</p>",

If Markle initially overplayed her hand at being our first Insta-ready royal, then some in the UK made the mistake of routinely debasing her as if she were some trashy reality TV celebrity. No judgment here (I love trashy reality TV celebrities), but they\u2019d be the first to acknowledge that their business model can be heavily reliant on negative attention. At least they get to fight back, unlike Markle. Until now. No wonder Harry feels the urge to protect her, like he couldn\u2019t his own mother. I imagine this isn\u2019t even about them \u2013 that the key is their son and the atmosphere they want him to grow up in. As for Markle, she arrived with a bounce but these days, even when she\u2019s smiling, there\u2019s anxiety in her eyes. Like a giant candlesnuffer has clanked down and a flame has gone out. Leadsom\u2019s coat of many colours? It must be panto season I have a rule about not commenting on female MPs\u2019 clothes. Male MPs all seem to wear the exact same cheap, depressing suit and no one ever comments. Yet female politicians endure relentless scrutiny for their sartorial choices, with every skirt, shoe and handbag criticised and analysed. The practice is reductive, patronising and\u2026 sorry, but I\u2019m going to have to make an exception. What was Andrea Leadsom wearing on a recent visit to No 10 \u2013 or was it wearing her? Her outfit was impossible to ignore and in a way that\u2019s beyond gender. She sported a Burberry \u201ccoat of many colours\u201d that admittedly may one day come in useful for an am-dram production of Joseph and His Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, teamed with a short skirt, sheer tights and knee boots. Full disclosure: I once dressed similarly to go to a festival, but at least I had the excuse that it was at the peak of acid house. To employ the vernacular of the era, dare I inquire if Leadsom is \u201con one\u201d? As I say, I would not stoop to analysing her clothes \u2013 wear what you like, girl! Let\u2019s just hope for her sake that this obvious bid to be considered for roles in the forthcoming panto season will be heeded. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

While Leicester probably expected a first-half battering they were just beginning to show some attacking enterprise of their own when they went behind, the ever-reliable Milner sending Man\u00e9 clear down the left with a pass from half way. Momentary hesitation from Jonny Evans saw the Liverpool forward overtake him on the inside, and once he reached the area unchecked a goal was inevitable, Man\u00e9 steering a low shot into the bottom corner. Leicester needed Schmeichel again to deny Salah at the start of the second half, yet though Caglar Soyuncu and Evans were stretched at times the visitors never allowed Liverpool to relax. In between shots from Firmino, Andy Robertson and Georginio Wijnaldum at Schmeichel\u2019s end Jamie Vardy got just the one sniff at the other, staying onside but showing Adri\u00e1n too much of the ball. The introduction of Ayoze P\u00e9rez made a difference for Leicester \u2013 it was the substitute\u2019s short pass that allowed Maddison to beat Adri\u00e1n with a shot on the turn. Leicester looked all set for a happy journey home until the drama in stoppage-time turned the afternoon on its head, with P\u00e9rez clearly miffed after the whistle at the exuberance of some of the Liverpool players\u2019 celebrations.",

The incident occurred on the A385 between Totnes and Paignton, near Lombcrombe Cross. Emergency services rescued passengers trapped in the wreckage of the Stagecoach South West vehicle after the crash at about 11am. Gerald Taylor, the Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service area manager, said the casualties were no longer at the scene of the collision. Devon and Cornwall police said roads had been closed and advised people to avoid the area. The force added that the driver of the bus had not been arrested but was helping police with its investigation. \u201cHealth partners have indicated there may now be up to eight casualties who are described as having potentially seriously injuries.\u201d The force said casualties were receiving treatment at hospitals across the region, while uninjured passengers were taken to Paignton bus station and Paignton Library to help them with their onward journeys. They added: \u201cAll casualties have left the location however the road will remain closed for [the] foreseeable future as investigative work continues at the scene.\u201d The bus had left Torquay at 10.10am and was heading towards Plymouth. A spokesman for Stagecoach South West confirmed that one of its buses was involved in the incident and that the company was helping the emergency services. He said: \u201cSafety is our absolute priority and we will be assisting the investigation into the circumstances involved in the incident.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When Dave Lewis took the helm of Tesco five years ago he whisked his 15 most senior managers off to a remote holiday cottage in Norfolk. There, the assembled executives were forced to step out of the executive bubble and get back to basics: shopping for food and cooking for themselves. It was the autumn of 2014 and the retail giant was in crisis. Its dominance of the British grocery landscape had come to a messy end as it was forced to confront the scale of the shopper exodus from its supermarkets, where the prices had risen and standards had fallen. The grocer had a mountain of debt after years of empire building under celebrated former leader Sir Terry Leahy, but the discovery of a gaping black hole in its accounts was a severe blow for what had been one of corporate Britain\u2019s biggest success stories. Fast forward to 2019 and Lewis\u2019s declaration last week that he had finished the turnaround job he set out to do: the business was once again on \u201cfirm foundations\u201d with a \u201csustainable\u201d growth plan. Profits are rising, the \u00a322bn debt pile he inherited has almost halved and \u00a31.6bn of costs have been carved out of the retailer. The former Unilever executive has also tackled its reputation for aggressive dealings with suppliers, and agreed to pay a \u00a3129m fine over the accounting scandal. The Tesco brand \u201cis stronger and customer satisfaction is the highest it has been for many years\u201d, he said. Expressing a desire to travel to Bhutan and spend more time with his family, Lewis said the job had been \u201call consuming\u201d and it was time to \u201cpass the baton\u201d to a new leader \u2013 in this case Ken Murphy, an Irish businessman who has spent much of his career working for health and beauty retailer Boots. The 2014 executive trip to Norfolk is an example of Lewis\u2019s back-to-basics approach. He used it to force his top managers \u2013 many of whom were used to crisscrossing the globe on the company\u2019s now long-gone corporate jets \u2013 to confront the day-to-day reality of food shopping like an ordinary customer. More importantly, it focused minds on how Tesco\u2019s prices and products compared with those of rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. \u201cI think if you\u2019re in our business and you\u2019re not spending all of your time looking at the quality and the presentation and the taste of the food and the products you serve \u2013 what are you doing?\u201d Lewis said at the time. The City was caught off guard by Lewis\u2019s desire to walk away next year, but Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said he deserves to be celebrated as the \u201cbloke that saved Tesco\u201d. \u201cIn terms of what Dave Lewis came into, it is mission accomplished,\u201d said Black. \u201cPeople forget what a shitshow it was when he arrived. There was no credible chairman or non-executives, and colleagues were about to be prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office. The business was in turmoil. Tesco could have gone under.\u201d Lewis\u2019s first set of annual results in 2015 was indeed a horror show: the company crashed to a \u00a36.4bn loss, he axed thousands of head-office jobs \u2013 including the retailer\u2019s famously austere Cheshunt headquarters in Hertfordshire \u2013 and closed more than 40 loss-making stores. In the 1990s and 2000s, the big supermarket chains had been engaged in a \u201cspace race\u201d \u2013 competing to see who could open the most stores. Under Leahy that race was won emphatically by Tesco as it added small convenience stores and huge department-store-style Extras. But the 2015 loss reflected a towering \u00a37bn of one-off costs, including \u00a34.7bn relating to a revaluation of its store estate. Despite Lewis\u2019s overhaul, Tesco\u2019s UK market share continues to drift downwards as the German discounters continue their rapacious expansion. This trend makes Lewis\u2019s decision to move into wholesaling \u2013 with the \u00a33.7bn take over of cash-and-carry group Booker \u2013 look far smarter than Sainsbury\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to merge with Asda, which was blocked by the competition watchdog. \u201cThe big four are competing for a smaller slice of the food market,\u201d said TCC Global analyst Bryan Roberts, who pointed to a prediction that in the long term the discounters would command a quarter of the UK grocery market. \u201cThere has been a structural shift into the discount channel that is not going away. It is about coming up with the best self-defence strategy.\u201d One of most successful decisions made by Lewis, who has a background in marketing, was to replace Tesco\u2019s cheapest own-label products with generic \u201cfarm\u201d brands and ersatz ranges \u2013 such as Bay Fishmongers, Ms Molly\u2019s desserts and Butcher\u2019s Choice \u2013 that stood up to comparison with discounters\u2019 products. He also abandoned the Leahy-era ambition of becoming a one-stop-shop, quitting unprofitable sectors like electricals, closing its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct and selling the Dobbies garden centre chain. \u201cThe Tesco business is much leaner, more efficient and has regained its focus on the shopper and delivering value to them,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cThere are fewer bells and whistles in the stores, but availability and service levels have improved.\u201d He added that the UK operation was \u201cpretty sorted\u201d, but pointed to a chequered overseas picture. \u201cPoland is still a bit of a shambles \u2013 Tesco has a fair bit of work to do there.\u201d One senior grocery industry executive said Lewis had done a good job of stabilising Tesco but questioned the long-term vision for the business, particularly its overseas operation, given the sale of its successful South Korean business and Kipa in Turkey. \u201cDave didn\u2019t pretend he was a retailer,\u201d they said. \u201cHe beefed up marketing and allowed the Tesco machine, which had been abused but was still there, to carry on.

Four years ago, when Law and Justice swept to power, winning the <a href=\"http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/70885/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-Law%20and%20Justices%20stunning%20victory%20in%20Poland%20reflected%20widespread%20disillusionment%20with%20the%20countrys%20ru.pdf\" title=\"\">first outright parliamentary majority</a> in the post-communist era, they did so partly through exploiting Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. The party\u2019s chairman and most influential figure, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/migrants-asylum-poland-kaczynski-election/\" title=\"\">pledged to shut Polish borders to an alleged 100,000 Muslim refugees</a> who, he said, would seek to impose sharia law in the country.</p> <p>This time around, LGBT rights seem to have been chosen as a useful anti-liberal battleground on which the party \u2013 and its clerical supporters \u2013 can show off their conservative credentials. At a \u201cpatriotic\u201d conference organised by the lay group Catholic Action last spring, <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20190425-kaczynski-calls-lgbt-rights-threat-poland\" title=\"\">Kaczy\u0144ski described LGBT rights and \u201cgender theory\u201d as a \u201cthreat to the nation\u201d. </a>Across the country, Pride-style marches have been condemned, contested and banned. Where they have taken place, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/world/europe/gay-pride-march-poland-violence.html\" title=\"\">counter-demonstrations have turned violent</a>. No one knows how many people have been the target of homophobic attacks because there is no hate-crime category in which they could be recorded. The atmosphere has turned toxic.</p> <p>Last month, Ormanty tried to persuade Kalwaria\u2019s council to adopt a resolution stating that \u201cgay ideology\u201d was \u201cannihilating Christian values\u201d and declaring the town an \u201cLGBT-free zone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about individuals, it\u2019s about the ideology,\u201d he says. \u201cThose people who demonstrate their sexuality openly are in effect attacking the church \u2026 I am a believer and a practising person, like most Poles: we have been baptised and we are believers, and therefore our goal is salvation. You achieve salvation by living a holy life, in line with the 10 commandments, and the commandment of love. The wellbeing of our children and grandchildren is at stake, because the equality movements blaspheme things we hold sacred.\u201d</p> <p>The mayor\u2019s anti-LGBT resolution was rejected by the council in favour of a milder one pledging to protect the \u201ctraditional family\u201d. But similar motions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/28/lgbt-gay-rights-poland-first-pride-march-bialystok-rage-violence\" title=\"\">have gone through elsewhere</a>, contributing to an alarming sense of polarisation ahead of next week\u2019s poll.</p> <p>Poland is bitterly divided between Catholic conservatives, who dominate small towns like Kalwaria and the rural areas, and secular liberals, who hold sway in the big cities such as Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w. The old, the less-educated and the less-wealthy are more likely to vote for Law and Justice. Wealthier Poles and the young gravitate to the liberal Civic Platform coalition or the leftwing United Left.</p> <p>The stakes could hardly be higher. The bullying and marginalisation of LGBT activists is only the latest example of the enthusiasm with which Law and Justice, with a certain version of God on its side, has flouted liberal democratic norms. The charge sheet drawn up by liberal opponents is long: the <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-poland-eu/poland-must-maintain-judicial-independence-human-rights-official-idUSKCN1TT0ZS\" title=\"\">independence of the Polish judiciary</a> has been undermined and judges friendly to the rightwing agenda placed in key positions; <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/assault-press-freedom-poland\" title=\"\">the country\u2019s public media has been ruthlessly exploited</a> to brazenly promote the government\u2019s agenda; <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/08/poland-is-trying-to-make-abortion-dangerous-illegal-and-impossible/\" title=\"\">women\u2019s reproductive rights have been relentlessly targeted</a>; corruption scandals involving public money have been frequent; the director of one of Poland\u2019s most important museums <a href=\"https://forward.com/culture/432537/5-months-after-his-selection-the-director-of-the-polish-jewish-museum/\" title=\"\">was frozen out after being accused of staging an \u201canti-Polish\u201d exhibition</a> on antisemitism. The government\u2019s refusal to form a lay commission to investigate revelations of paedophilia in the church has been judged a cynical cover-up on behalf of a crucial ally.</p> <p>The allegations and condemnations have piled up at home and abroad, not least from the European Commission in Brussels. Yet the Law and Justice party <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2019_Polish_parliamentary_election\" title=\"\">continues to poll </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2019_Polish_parliamentary_election\" title=\"\">close to 20 points ahead of Civic Platform,</a> the liberal coalition of parties that lost power in 2015.

But the smart money is on four more years of religious nationalism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"27197e086a3e17c6cc3b8fcf7eff2e0a86305859\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27197e086a3e17c6cc3b8fcf7eff2e0a86305859/0_170_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Law and Justice party chairman Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski greets nuns in Warsaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Law and Justice party chairman Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski greets nuns in Warsaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the standards of the Polish church, Father Jacek Prusak, a Jesuit priest and professor at the Ignatian Academy in Krak\u00f3w, could be considered a turbulent priest. He is one of a small minority of clerics willing to challenge the hand-in-glove cooperation of church and state under the present dispensation. But he warns against a simplistic reading of Law and Justice as a purely rightwing and reactionary phenomenon. \u201cThey do not conform to traditional left-right divisions,\u201d says Prusak. \u201cIt\u2019s culturally rightwing and economically leftwing. The welfare policies can be seen as within the spirit of Catholic social teaching.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, religion, he says \u201cis being used as a weapon in Law and Justice\u2019s culture wars. The party picks the aspects of church teaching that it prefers. Take refugees, for example. Look at what <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/29/world/europe/pope-francis-migrants-sculpture.html\" title=\"\">Pope Francis says about the need to welcome and help refugees</a> and compare that to the Law and Justice approach. And as far as LGBT issues are concerned, when I preach, I preach about the gospel, and in the gospel there is no mention of homosexuality.\u201d</p> <p>What Law and Justice is trying to do, says Prusak, with the complicity of much of the established church, \u201cis equate being Polish with being a good Catholic. And a good Catholic Pole will be a loyal Law and Justice supporter. This is the politicisation of the church; it\u2019s reducing the church to a tribal vision.\u201d</p> <p>It is also, say the government\u2019s many critics, an authoritarian vision. In campaign rallies, Kaczy\u0144ski likes to talk about \u201cdecent Poles\u201d; the right-thinking, Catholic types on whose behalf Law and Justice fearlessly governs. In this majoritarian world, civic pluralism and protecting the rights of minorities are not priorities.</p> <p>The palpable fear among liberals and on the left is that a second term for Law and Justice will irrevocably entrench its power within the institutions of civil society. Last week, <em>Gazeta Wyborcza</em>, the newspaper which made its name in the Solidarity era, published a special supplement entitled <em>The Black Book of PiS</em> (Law and Justice). \u201cHow Poland became one political party\u2019s loot.\u201d According to the sociologist Rados\u0142aw Markowski, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/07/26/why-is-polands-law-and-justice-party-trying-to-rein-in-the-judiciary/\" title=\"\">who has been a thorn in the side of the Law and Justice administration</a>, \u201cpopulism is a lazy catch-all description of this.

The government may be authoritarian, but it is also popular. For four years it has undeniably shown a striking commitment to the less wealthy. Among huge numbers of Poles on modest incomes, it is seen as that rare thing: a political party that kept its promises.</p> <p>Piotr Janusiewicz is the Law and Justice-backed president of the town council in Kalwaria and the headmaster of the local secondary school. He says the impact of social spending has been \u201cdecisive\u201d.</p> <p>In power, Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s party <a href=\"https://www.transform-network.net/en/focus/overview/article/radical-far-and-populist-right/the-law-and-justice-party-and-polands-turn-to-the-right-1/\" title=\"\">claims to have overseen the biggest redistribution of wealth in Poland</a> since the end of communism in 1989. Its flagship 500 Plus programme gives parents a monthly subsidy of \u00a3103 (500 z\u0142oty) for their second child and the same for every subsequent addition to the family. Low-income parents receive the same, life-changing, amount for their first child. The scheme was extended in July this year to cover every child, including the first one, without any income threshold.</p> <p>\u201cAt my school, I have seen the transformation of the 500 Plus at first-hand,\u201d says Janusiewicz. \u201cA family with three children has \u00a3310 more each month. Imagine the difference that makes. Families are going on holiday more. Parents can afford to send their children to scout camps and extra-curricular activities. The clothes that pupils from the poorer families wear are of better quality.\u201d Voluntary donations used to be collected at the school to provide financial assistance and meals to the poorest pupils. \u201cWe closed the fund,\u201d says Janusiewicz. \u201cIt\u2019s not needed any more. Self-esteem has been restored to those people in need.\u201d</p> <p>The 500 Plus strategy was presented as a patriotic, nation-building solution to Poland\u2019s declining birth-rate. It also ticked the Catholic pro-family box and made a point about priorities in a country where same-sex marriage is illegal and gay adoption off the agenda. Critics described it as a transparent bribe to win votes. But the most concrete net effect has been to lift hundreds of thousands of Poles out of poverty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No one gave anything to help families like us before.</p> <footer> <cite>Ewelina Gastol, mother of two</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.transform-network.net/en/focus/overview/article/radical-far-and-populist-right/the-law-and-justice-party-and-polands-turn-to-the-right-1/\" title=\"\">State pensions have also been boosted. The retirement age has been lowered and the minimum wage raised.</a> In a second term in office, Law and Justice has promised to double the minimum wage by 2023, distribute annual cash bonuses to pensioners, boost farming subsidies and invest heavily in improving transport in the provinces and rural areas.</p> <p>The huge level of state spending appears to have boosted rather than damaged Poland\u2019s finances. Levels of private consumption have gone up significantly, fuelling<a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/25/how-poland-s-golden-age-of-economic-growth-is-going-unreported-view\" title=\"\"> a stellar growth rate last year of 5.1%</a>, which far outstrips the eurozone. This, according to the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, is what \u201cPolish capitalism\u201d looks like, in contrast to the austerity version on offer elsewhere in the EU. During the summer, Kaczy\u0144ski told a summer rally of supporters that the \u201csystem that existed before, where the fruits of growth were not equally divided \u2026 has in large part been corrected.\u201d</p> <p>Ewelina Gastol, a 33-year-old nurse and mother of two small children, lives in the village of Kryspin\u00f3w, near Krak\u00f3w. She says that the new money available has changed things for her and her husband, a fireman. \u201cFinally I can afford to pay for a creche. And since we had a second baby, I\u2019ve been able to put some of the extra money into a fund for the children for when they grow up,\u201d she says. Other parents at the local primary school have enthusiastically signed their children up for hip-hop dance classes and other extracurricular activities that would previously have been the province of the better-off.</p> <p>Having criticised Law and Justice\u2019s plans as unaffordable, opposition parties have now pledged to maintain the 500 Plus programme and made their own commitments to greater welfare spending. But Civic Platform in particular faces a credibility gap. Why, when it ran Poland between 2007 and 2014 \u2013 and the current president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, was prime minister \u2013 did it fail to deliver anything remotely similar?</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Gastol is thinking of voting for Law and Justice next week: \u201cNo one gave anything to help families like us before. And when you look at the political alternatives, well, there don\u2019t seem to be any you could trust.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0644f56c44b723e7129fedb6867172dafe68f5a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0644f56c44b723e7129fedb6867172dafe68f5a9/0_99_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"LGBT campaigner Magda Dropek.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LGBT campaigner Magda Dropek.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Unknown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next week, Magda Dropek, an LGBT activist, will stand for election in Krak\u00f3w. Running on the United Left slate, which stands at about 14% in polls, Dropek, 37, has spent the past few weeks dividing her time between campaigning and organising small-town outreach for the Krak\u00f3w-based Equality Foundation. For obvious reasons, she is no fan of Law and Justice. But she believes the Polish left can learn from the party\u2019s economic policies. \u201cIt has to be acknowledged that they are the ones who have given money to ordinary people. They have given dignity back to a lot of people who have been forgotten in the decades of economic transformation.\u201d That said, Dropek has spent 10 years fighting tooth and nail against the Catholic conservativism that Law and Justice stands for. Last month, that mission took her to Kalwaria\u2019s community centre.</p> <p>When Mayor Ormanty took his \u201cLGBT-free\u201d resolution to the council in the summer, Dropek\u2019s foundation raised some money to place a colourful billboard poster in Kalwaria\u2019s town centre. Featuring a pair of clasped hands and a rainbow wristband, it read simply: \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Within hours, it had been torn down. Then when she found out that the mayor had organised a conference at the community centre on the LGBT \u201cthreat\u201d, Dropek decided to go along. The conference, predictably enough, was attended by priests and a few politicians and supporters of Law and Justice. \u201cBut what was really shocking,\u201d she says, \u201cwas the number of teachers present, including the schools superintendent for the Krak\u00f3w region.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Law and Justice believes Poland has a historic mission to re-evangelise the world \u2013 it\u2019s based on a myth.</p> <footer> <cite>Jacek Prusak, priest</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dropek was determined to be polite and constructive, so during the meeting she held her tongue. But eventually she could take no more. \u201cI stood up to say, \u2018I am a person, not an ideology, and I\u2019m very hurt by this discussion\u2019. I asked the mayor if my group could organise an event in the centre and talk to people from the town.</p> <p>\u201cAt first he wouldn\u2019t respond. Then he said: \u2018You have to understand that this is a very special place. John Paul II is an honorary citizen here.\u2019 Then a priest told me the talk was not directed at people but at an \u2018ideology\u2019 which was contrary to Catholic values. Other members of the audience said they could help me change my sexuality if I was willing to try. One man asked me if I was aware what Lenin did with people like me.\u201d</p> <p>Both Dropek\u2019s parents are devout Catholics but are appalled by the homophobic language of the government and its powerful allies in the church. \u201cThe government and the church give permission through their rhetoric to the far-right nationalists and the football ultras who are attacking LGBT people. My mother is frightened on my behalf.\u201d</p> <p>Last month the archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, Marek J\u0119draszewiski, <a href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/polish-archbishop-compares-lgbt-advancement-to-communist-oppression\" title=\"\">issued a pastoral letter to be read out at all of Krakow\u2019s many churches</a>. \u201cThe next great threat to our freedom has appeared,\u201d writes the archbishop.

      "bodyText": "\u201cEvery good Pole should know what the role of the church is \u2026 because beyond the church there is only nihilism.\u201d \u2013 Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, chairman of the Law and Justice party, 7 September High on the wall of mayor Augustyn Ormanty\u2019s office in the town of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska, photographs show him welcoming Pope Saint John Paul II on two occasions to what the mayor describes as \u201cthe spiritual capital\u201d of southern Poland. \u201cI met him five times in all,\u201d Ormanty says proudly. \u201cIn 1997 we made the pope an honorary citizen. He\u2019s the only one to have that honour.\u201d Kalwaria is one of the most significant sites of Catholic pilgrimage in Europe. Its huge 17th-century church and chapels, forming a route modelled on Christ\u2019s passion, were a favourite destination of the \u201cPolish pope\u201d, who grew up in nearby Wadowice. From the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, the baroque basilica of St Mary\u2019s looks down on a compact community of 5,000 people, which has a reputation for making fine household furniture. Although he belongs to a small, rural party, Ormanty, 65, is a loyal and passionate supporter of Poland\u2019s controversial Law and Justice government, which has a strong chance of winning a second term in office after next Sunday\u2019s general election. Another photograph on his wall shows the mayor with Andrzej Duda, the Law and Justice stalwart who was elected president in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented what is being done on social welfare,\u201d he says. \u201cThis has gone not just to families, the government is taking care of the disabled and the elderly too. Last month we opened a new centre for the disabled which is helping 30 residents.\u201d Ormanty believes that, beyond economics, Law and Justice are fighting the good fight in the battle to defeat the secular liberal values that have corrupted western European nations and which are threatening to do the same in Catholic Poland. On the mayor\u2019s desk, a small collection of books includes a volume by his brother, a distinguished priest. There is also a work entitled: \u201cThe Destructive \u2018Equality\u2019 of the LBGTQ ideology; allegedly anti-discriminatory and progressive policies as instruments of discrimination and destruction.\u201d For Ormanty and in much of Poland, this is the hot topic of the day. Four years ago, when Law and Justice swept to power, winning the first outright parliamentary majority in the post-communist era, they did so partly through exploiting Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. The party\u2019s chairman and most influential figure, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, pledged to shut Polish borders to an alleged 100,000 Muslim refugees who, he said, would seek to impose sharia law in the country. This time around, LGBT rights seem to have been chosen as a useful anti-liberal battleground on which the party \u2013 and its clerical supporters \u2013 can show off their conservative credentials. At a \u201cpatriotic\u201d conference organised by the lay group Catholic Action last spring, Kaczy\u0144ski described LGBT rights and \u201cgender theory\u201d as a \u201cthreat to the nation\u201d. Across the country, Pride-style marches have been condemned, contested and banned. Where they have taken place, counter-demonstrations have turned violent. No one knows how many people have been the target of homophobic attacks because there is no hate-crime category in which they could be recorded. The atmosphere has turned toxic. Last month, Ormanty tried to persuade Kalwaria\u2019s council to adopt a resolution stating that \u201cgay ideology\u201d was \u201cannihilating Christian values\u201d and declaring the town an \u201cLGBT-free zone\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not about individuals, it\u2019s about the ideology,\u201d he says. \u201cThose people who demonstrate their sexuality openly are in effect attacking the church \u2026 I am a believer and a practising person, like most Poles: we have been baptised and we are believers, and therefore our goal is salvation. You achieve salvation by living a holy life, in line with the 10 commandments, and the commandment of love. The wellbeing of our children and grandchildren is at stake, because the equality movements blaspheme things we hold sacred.\u201d The mayor\u2019s anti-LGBT resolution was rejected by the council in favour of a milder one pledging to protect the \u201ctraditional family\u201d. But similar motions have gone through elsewhere, contributing to an alarming sense of polarisation ahead of next week\u2019s poll. Poland is bitterly divided between Catholic conservatives, who dominate small towns like Kalwaria and the rural areas, and secular liberals, who hold sway in the big cities such as Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w. The old, the less-educated and the less-wealthy are more likely to vote for Law and Justice. Wealthier Poles and the young gravitate to the liberal Civic Platform coalition or the leftwing United Left. The stakes could hardly be higher. The bullying and marginalisation of LGBT activists is only the latest example of the enthusiasm with which Law and Justice, with a certain version of God on its side, has flouted liberal democratic norms. The charge sheet drawn up by liberal opponents is long: the independence of the Polish judiciary has been undermined and judges friendly to the rightwing agenda placed in key positions; the country\u2019s public media has been ruthlessly exploited to brazenly promote the government\u2019s agenda; women\u2019s reproductive rights have been relentlessly targeted; corruption scandals involving public money have been frequent; the director of one of Poland\u2019s most important museums was frozen out after being accused of staging an \u201canti-Polish\u201d exhibition on antisemitism. The government\u2019s refusal to form a lay commission to investigate revelations of paedophilia in the church has been judged a cynical cover-up on behalf of a crucial ally. The allegations and condemnations have piled up at home and abroad, not least from the European Commission in Brussels. Yet the Law and Justice party continues to poll close to 20 points ahead of Civic Platform, the liberal coalition of parties that lost power in 2015. If the combined vote of the opposition parties beats Law and Justice next Sunday, there is a chance that an alternative government could be formed. But the smart money is on four more years of religious nationalism. By the standards of the Polish church, Father Jacek Prusak, a Jesuit priest and professor at the Ignatian Academy in Krak\u00f3w, could be considered a turbulent priest. He is one of a small minority of clerics willing to challenge the hand-in-glove cooperation of church and state under the present dispensation. But he warns against a simplistic reading of Law and Justice as a purely rightwing and reactionary phenomenon. \u201cThey do not conform to traditional left-right divisions,\u201d says Prusak. \u201cIt\u2019s culturally rightwing and economically leftwing. The welfare policies can be seen as within the spirit of Catholic social teaching.\u201d Nevertheless, religion, he says \u201cis being used as a weapon in Law and Justice\u2019s culture wars. The party picks the aspects of church teaching that it prefers. Take refugees, for example. Look at what Pope Francis says about the need to welcome and help refugees and compare that to the Law and Justice approach. And as far as LGBT issues are concerned, when I preach, I preach about the gospel, and in the gospel there is no mention of homosexuality.\u201d What Law and Justice is trying to do, says Prusak, with the complicity of much of the established church, \u201cis equate being Polish with being a good Catholic. And a good Catholic Pole will be a loyal Law and Justice supporter. This is the politicisation of the church; it\u2019s reducing the church to a tribal vision.\u201d It is also, say the government\u2019s many critics, an authoritarian vision. In campaign rallies, Kaczy\u0144ski likes to talk about \u201cdecent Poles\u201d; the right-thinking, Catholic types on whose behalf Law and Justice fearlessly governs. In this majoritarian world, civic pluralism and protecting the rights of minorities are not priorities. The palpable fear among liberals and on the left is that a second term for Law and Justice will irrevocably entrench its power within the institutions of civil society. Last week, Gazeta Wyborcza, the newspaper which made its name in the Solidarity era, published a special supplement entitled The Black Book of PiS (Law and Justice). \u201cHow Poland became one political party\u2019s loot.\u201d According to the sociologist Rados\u0142aw Markowski, who has been a thorn in the side of the Law and Justice administration, \u201cpopulism is a lazy catch-all description of this. This is authoritarian clientelism.\u201d But opposition parties seeking to oust Law and Justice from office find themselves faced with an uncomfortable truth. The government may be authoritarian, but it is also popular. For four years it has undeniably shown a striking commitment to the less wealthy. Among huge numbers of Poles on modest incomes, it is seen as that rare thing: a political party that kept its promises. Piotr Janusiewicz is the Law and Justice-backed president of the town council in Kalwaria and the headmaster of the local secondary school. He says the impact of social spending has been \u201cdecisive\u201d. In power, Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s party claims to have overseen the biggest redistribution of wealth in Poland since the end of communism in 1989. Its flagship 500 Plus programme gives parents a monthly subsidy of \u00a3103 (500 z\u0142oty) for their second child and the same for every subsequent addition to the family. Low-income parents receive the same, life-changing, amount for their first child. The scheme was extended in July this year to cover every child, including the first one, without any income threshold. \u201cAt my school, I have seen the transformation of the 500 Plus at first-hand,\u201d says Janusiewicz. \u201cA family with three children has \u00a3310 more each month. Imagine the difference that makes. Families are going on holiday more. Parents can afford to send their children to scout camps and extra-curricular activities. The clothes that pupils from the poorer families wear are of better quality.\u201d Voluntary donations used to be collected at the school to provide financial assistance and meals to the poorest pupils. \u201cWe closed the fund,\u201d says Janusiewicz. \u201cIt\u2019s not needed any more. Self-esteem has been restored to those people in need.\u201d The 500 Plus strategy was presented as a patriotic, nation-building solution to Poland\u2019s declining birth-rate. It also ticked the Catholic pro-family box and made a point about priorities in a country where same-sex marriage is illegal and gay adoption off the agenda. Critics described it as a transparent bribe to win votes. But the most concrete net effect has been to lift hundreds of thousands of Poles out of poverty. State pensions have also been boosted. The retirement age has been lowered and the minimum wage raised. In a second term in office, Law and Justice has promised to double the minimum wage by 2023, distribute annual cash bonuses to pensioners, boost farming subsidies and invest heavily in improving transport in the provinces and rural areas. The huge level of state spending appears to have boosted rather than damaged Poland\u2019s finances. Levels of private consumption have gone up significantly, fuelling a stellar growth rate last year of 5.1%, which far outstrips the eurozone. This, according to the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, is what \u201cPolish capitalism\u201d looks like, in contrast to the austerity version on offer elsewhere in the EU. During the summer, Kaczy\u0144ski told a summer rally of supporters that the \u201csystem that existed before, where the fruits of growth were not equally divided \u2026 has in large part been corrected.\u201d Ewelina Gastol, a 33-year-old nurse and mother of two small children, lives in the village of Kryspin\u00f3w, near Krak\u00f3w. She says that the new money available has changed things for her and her husband, a fireman. \u201cFinally I can afford to pay for a creche. And since we had a second baby, I\u2019ve been able to put some of the extra money into a fund for the children for when they grow up,\u201d she says. Other parents at the local primary school have enthusiastically signed their children up for hip-hop dance classes and other extracurricular activities that would previously have been the province of the better-off. Having criticised Law and Justice\u2019s plans as unaffordable, opposition parties have now pledged to maintain the 500 Plus programme and made their own commitments to greater welfare spending. But Civic Platform in particular faces a credibility gap. Why, when it ran Poland between 2007 and 2014 \u2013 and the current president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, was prime minister \u2013 did it fail to deliver anything remotely similar? Unsurprisingly, Gastol is thinking of voting for Law and Justice next week: \u201cNo one gave anything to help families like us before. And when you look at the political alternatives, well, there don\u2019t seem to be any you could trust.\u201d Next week, Magda Dropek, an LGBT activist, will stand for election in Krak\u00f3w. Running on the United Left slate, which stands at about 14% in polls, Dropek, 37, has spent the past few weeks dividing her time between campaigning and organising small-town outreach for the Krak\u00f3w-based Equality Foundation. For obvious reasons, she is no fan of Law and Justice. But she believes the Polish left can learn from the party\u2019s economic policies. \u201cIt has to be acknowledged that they are the ones who have given money to ordinary people. They have given dignity back to a lot of people who have been forgotten in the decades of economic transformation.\u201d That said, Dropek has spent 10 years fighting tooth and nail against the Catholic conservativism that Law and Justice stands for. Last month, that mission took her to Kalwaria\u2019s community centre. When Mayor Ormanty took his \u201cLGBT-free\u201d resolution to the council in the summer, Dropek\u2019s foundation raised some money to place a colourful billboard poster in Kalwaria\u2019s town centre. Featuring a pair of clasped hands and a rainbow wristband, it read simply: \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Within hours, it had been torn down. Then when she found out that the mayor had organised a conference at the community centre on the LGBT \u201cthreat\u201d, Dropek decided to go along. The conference, predictably enough, was attended by priests and a few politicians and supporters of Law and Justice. \u201cBut what was really shocking,\u201d she says, \u201cwas the number of teachers present, including the schools superintendent for the Krak\u00f3w region.\u201d Dropek was determined to be polite and constructive, so during the meeting she held her tongue. But eventually she could take no more. \u201cI stood up to say, \u2018I am a person, not an ideology, and I\u2019m very hurt by this discussion\u2019. I asked the mayor if my group could organise an event in the centre and talk to people from the town. \u201cAt first he wouldn\u2019t respond. Then he said: \u2018You have to understand that this is a very special place. John Paul II is an honorary citizen here.\u2019 Then a priest told me the talk was not directed at people but at an \u2018ideology\u2019 which was contrary to Catholic values. Other members of the audience said they could help me change my sexuality if I was willing to try. One man asked me if I was aware what Lenin did with people like me.\u201d Both Dropek\u2019s parents are devout Catholics but are appalled by the homophobic language of the government and its powerful allies in the church. \u201cThe government and the church give permission through their rhetoric to the far-right nationalists and the football ultras who are attacking LGBT people. My mother is frightened on my behalf.\u201d Last month the archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, Marek J\u0119draszewiski, issued a pastoral letter to be read out at all of Krakow\u2019s many churches. \u201cThe next great threat to our freedom has appeared,\u201d writes the archbishop. When a child succumbs to LGBT ideology, \u201cfor a parent there is no bigger tragedy\u201d. When Law and Justice was elected four years ago, she tried to be optimistic on her Facebook page: \u201cCome on!\u201d she wrote: \u201cCan they really destroy everything in four years?\u201d As bad as those years have been, she believes they have also acted as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d, and places her faith in the young people, gay and straight, who she sees on the equality marches in Krak\u00f3w. \u201cThey\u2019re not old enough to vote now, but they will be in four years. They\u2019re raised on Netflix shows and they really don\u2019t know what the fuss is about. Equality is just normality for them. That\u2019s what the future looks like.\u201d Father Jacek Prusak also believes that this golden moment for Catholic nationalism in Poland has a demographic sell-by date. \u201cLaw and Justice believes Poland has a historic mission to re-evangelise the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s based on a myth. To equate Poland with Catholicism may have been valid in the postwar period, but it wasn\u2019t the case before the second world war, when Poland was a multicultural, multi-faith country. And it isn\u2019t valid now, when statistics show that the under-21 age group is secularising at the fastest rate in the world. The \u2018Catholic Poland\u2019 that Law and Justice try to exploit for their own ends will prove to have been a historical reality for a very limited period of time.\u201d For those who fear that Poland\u2019s bitter divides have reached crisis point, that will be a consoling thought. But in the short-term, it seems probable that Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s brand of Catholic nationalism will be given four more years to make Poland a country fit for \u201cdecent Poles\u201d. Law and Justice\u2019s rise to power 2001 The party is founded by the Kaczy\u0144ski twins, Lech and Jaros\u0142aw, as an overtly Christian party of the centre-right.

Tusk serves a second term after Civic Platform wins again in 2011. He pursues liberal economic policies and pledges to take Poland into the eurozone. Law and Justice begins to position itself on the nationalist right. 2010 Lech Kaczy\u0144ski dies in a plane crash during a failed landing attempt by a Polish air force jet in Russia. His wife is also killed, along with the 94 other passengers. In Poland a week of mourning is declared. 2015 Law and Justice becomes the first party to win a parliamentary majority since the fall of communism, after campaigning on a nationalist, socially conservative platform. Its backing comes mainly from smaller towns and rural areas. Beata Szyd\u0142o, a coalminer\u2019s daughter, is appointed prime minister and launches a lavish social spending programme.

      "bodyText": "A second intelligence official is reportedly considering filing a whistleblower complaint about Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as the Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation into the president and his administration continues to escalate. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also failed to meet a subpoena deadline to turn over documents related to the investigation, as House Democrats broadened their subpoena request to the White House, demanding documents after the executive branch ignored requests to provide them voluntarily. At the heart of the impeachment inquiry is a whistleblower complaint outlining Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to launch a corruption investigation against the former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump has since publicly urged Ukraine, and China, to investigate Biden, without citing any evidence of any wrongdoing. The second official considering filing a whistleblower complaint about the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine has more direct information about the events in question than the initial whistleblower and was interviewed by an intelligence watchdog to corroborate the first report, the New York Times reported late Friday, citing two anonymous sources. Elsewhere, the Washington Post reported accounts of a number of Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders, citing an anonymous former White House official. The paper said in one of his first calls with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Trump fawned over him, and in a call with the former UK prime minister Theresa May, Trump questioned British intelligence\u2019s conclusion that Putin\u2019s government was behind an attempt to kill a former Russian spy on British soil with a nerve agent. Trump on Saturday hit out at both papers. The president has defended his open calls for foreign governments to investigate a political rival by repeating that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d. Text messages between US diplomats and an assistant to Zelenskiy released this week reveal that this was not the understanding of US diplomats dealing with Ukraine. In a tweet on Thursday, Trump said the presidency gave him \u201can absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d Pompeo: \u2018We\u2019ll do the things required by law\u2019 Speaking to reporters in Greece on Saturday, the secretary of state, Pompeo, did not reference Trump\u2019s admitted desire for Ukraine to investigate Biden, but said the investigation the US sought was related to Ukraine\u2019s possible interference in the 2016 US election. On Wednesday, Pompeo admitted he had been on a controversial July call with Zelenskiy in which the president pressured Ukraine, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House. Three congressional committees subpoenaed Pompeo after the state department failed to produce documents related to the Ukraine inquiry. He also missed a Friday deadline to turn over documents to the committees, which have scheduled depositions for five state department officials who have been mentioned in relation to the inquiry. In Greece, Pompeo said the state department responded to the subpoenas on Friday night, but did not say what the response was. \u201cWe\u2019ll obviously do the things we are required to do by law,\u201d Pompeo said, adding that these inquiries have \u201charassed and abused\u201d state department employees. In an effort to shed light on these dealings, House Democrats subpoenaed the White House demanding documents related to Ukraine on Friday night. They have also formally requested documents from the vice-president, Mike Pence, who had a meeting with Zelenskiy on 1 September. Few congressional Republicans or commentators have spoken against Trump after the president urged two foreign governments, Ukraine and China, to investigate a political rival this week. Among those that have are Senator Mitt Romney, of Utah, who said Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and China were \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cappalling\u201d. Trump\u2019s tweets on Saturday targeted Romney saying: \u201cSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him my conversation was a congenial and very appropriate one.\u201d Meanwhile, the representative Will Hurd, of Texas, criticized Trump\u2019s suggestion that China should investigate the Bidens, but said there needed to be a full investigation of the Ukraine conversation, in an interview with CNN. \u201cI think some of these things are indeed damning, however I want to make sure we get through this entire investigation before coming to some kind of conclusion,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cI think this is serious stuff.

I first got interested in linguistics proper when I was about 12 \u2013 I picked up a book that happened to be about pop linguistics and thought it was the most amazing thing. I think, like many linguists, I have a difficult time turning the linguistics part of my brain off. If you get me at the pub, I may be trying to listen to what you\u2019re saying and then get distracted by your vowels. So to be interested in the way people talk on the internet is just a natural extension of being interested in how people talk around me on an everyday basis.

Do you think older, or less online, people can get to grips with the new rules? </strong><br>I think there\u2019s a level to which it\u2019s intuitive, but there\u2019s also a level under conscious control. I\u2019ve had people say to me: \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to stop using a full stop at the end of text messages, because I\u2019ve now realised that people are interpreting it as being passive aggressive.\u201d There are certain, very explicit things everyone can be more aware of. One of the things I hope to do with <em>Because Internet</em> is foster this kind of dialogue between generations, because there doesn\u2019t have to be one right way of doing things. I\u2019m not saying that everyone has to talk like they\u2019re a younger person, it can be just as valuable for young people to say: \u201cOK, this older person is not actually trying to be passive aggressive when they send me this full stop.\u201d</p> <p><strong>But some older people do get angry when younger generations use slang or miss out punctuation. You say this behaviour is deliberate and imbued with meaning, not lazy or wrong.

In reality, people are acting for deliberate reasons, and I\u2019m figuring out what those reasons are. I think that it can come as a tremendous relief to realise that you don\u2019t have to be angry about language, you don\u2019t have to be annoyed about people doing something different from you.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve figured out a lot of why we do what we do \u2013 we use excessive lettersssss to heighten emotion, and use ~tildes~ to be sarcastic. But is there an element of internet language that stumps you? </strong><br>I\u2019ve been spending a fair bit of time recently with the comma ellipsis, which is three commas (,,,) instead of dot-dot-dot. I\u2019ve been looking at it for over a year and I\u2019m still figuring out what\u2019s going on there. There seems to be something but possibly several somethings.</p> <p>One use is by older people who, in some cases where they would use the classic ellipsis, use commas instead. It\u2019s not quite clear if that\u2019s a typo in some cases, but it seems to be more systematic than that. Maybe they\u2019re preferring the comma because it\u2019s a little bit easier to see if you\u2019re on the older side, and your vision is not what it once was. Or maybe they just see the two as equivalent. It then seems to have jumped the shark into parody form. There\u2019s a Facebook group in which younger people pretend to be to be baby boomers, and one of the features people use there is this comma ellipsis. And then in some circles there also seems to be a use of comma ellipses that is very, very heavily ironic. But what exactly the nature is of that heavy irony is still something that I\u2019m working on figuring out.</p> <p><strong>It must be difficult to write about something that\u2019s changing all the time. In your book you reference HHOJ (ha ha only joking), an </strong><strong>abbreviation from the 1990s I\u2019d never heard of. Why would that fall out of favour when \u201clol\u201d has stuck around? </strong><br>It\u2019s funny, because in the 90s lists of acronyms would circulate, but I think only a few were ever really in common use. There\u2019s a real tendency in media reports to sensationalise internet languages, so we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really how anyone talked. There was a fad for acronyms in the 1800s as well. It seems like a very internet-y phenomenon: a couple hundred years ago, people used acronyms of deliberate misspellings of phrases. One example was KG, which stood for \u201cno good\u201d, but the \u201cno\u201d was spelt \u201cknow\u201d as a deliberate, stylised misspelling, just like we see online. But the only one from that time that actually stuck around was OK. OK was a deliberate misspelling of \u201call correct\u201d but spelled \u201coll korrect\u201d. And OK still kind of feels like an acronym, but people don\u2019t think of it as standing for anything in particular. When I look at \u201clol\u201d I see something similar \u2013 a whole trend of making a bunch of words into acronyms but only a few have really stuck.</p> <p><strong>There seems to be a</strong><strong> historical precedent for a lot of our weird online behaviour</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>What one finding surprised you the most? </strong><br>Older people sometimes use \u201c\u2026\u201d to separate thoughts online, which can baffle younger people [an example from the book: \u201ci just had to beat 2 danish guys at ping poong.....&amp;..they were good....glad i havent lost my chops\u201d]. I was very excited to find the dot-dot-dot had an offline origin in letters and postcards. George Harrison sent a postcard to the other Beatles using dot-dot-dots, and it really does look like a text message from your parents or grandparents from a different era. It was really fascinating to me.</p> <p><strong>Did you expect to find so many historical precedents? </strong><br>I hadn\u2019t planned to keep coming back to the theme of offline origins, but I did. I had a feeling that people tend to sort of exoticise the internet and think of it as a place where all of the old rules don\u2019t apply, but in many respects people are still people, and we still bring ourselves and our cultures with us when we go on the internet.</p> <p>A lot more things than we might give credit for do have offline origins, whether that\u2019s sending something in ALL CAPS, or sending little pictures alongside your messages, or making media references the same way people make meme references in conversation now. To realise that all of these have offline equivalents, it\u2019s kind of a relaxing way to think about it.

In your book you reference HHOJ (ha ha only joking), an abbreviation from the 1990s I\u2019d never heard of. Why would that fall out of favour when \u201clol\u201d has stuck around? It\u2019s funny, because in the 90s lists of acronyms would circulate, but I think only a few were ever really in common use. There\u2019s a real tendency in media reports to sensationalise internet languages, so we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really how anyone talked. There was a fad for acronyms in the 1800s as well. It seems like a very internet-y phenomenon: a couple hundred years ago, people used acronyms of deliberate misspellings of phrases. One example was KG, which stood for \u201cno good\u201d, but the \u201cno\u201d was spelt \u201cknow\u201d as a deliberate, stylised misspelling, just like we see online. But the only one from that time that actually stuck around was OK. OK was a deliberate misspelling of \u201call correct\u201d but spelled \u201coll korrect\u201d. And OK still kind of feels like an acronym, but people don\u2019t think of it as standing for anything in particular. When I look at \u201clol\u201d I see something similar \u2013 a whole trend of making a bunch of words into acronyms but only a few have really stuck. There seems to be a historical precedent for a lot of our weird online behaviour. What one finding surprised you the most? Older people sometimes use \u201c\u2026\u201d to separate thoughts online, which can baffle younger people [an example from the book: \u201ci just had to beat 2 danish guys at ping poong.....&amp;..they were good....glad i havent lost my chops\u201d]. I was very excited to find the dot-dot-dot had an offline origin in letters and postcards. George Harrison sent a postcard to the other Beatles using dot-dot-dots, and it really does look like a text message from your parents or grandparents from a different era. It was really fascinating to me. Did you expect to find so many historical precedents? I hadn\u2019t planned to keep coming back to the theme of offline origins, but I did. I had a feeling that people tend to sort of exoticise the internet and think of it as a place where all of the old rules don\u2019t apply, but in many respects people are still people, and we still bring ourselves and our cultures with us when we go on the internet. A lot more things than we might give credit for do have offline origins, whether that\u2019s sending something in ALL CAPS, or sending little pictures alongside your messages, or making media references the same way people make meme references in conversation now. To realise that all of these have offline equivalents, it\u2019s kind of a relaxing way to think about it. Not everything has to be new.

She wishes she wasn\u2019t so precious about peace and quiet and remembers she didn\u2019t used to be. In fact, she used to sit next to a man in a newspaper office who was covered in nicotine patches, chewing nicotine gum and drinking double espressos until he vibrated. Still, she always met the deadline. He didn\u2019t, so was in a constant state of torture.</p> <p>Things changed, journalism changed and she no longer had to go to the office. Indeed, when working for a rightwing newspaper she told the editor that doing so was making her depressed as they were all fascists. She was vaguely hoping to be fired. Instead she was sent flowers and told she never had to come in any more. She had been managed successfully, she realised later, which was an entirely new experience for her.</p> <p>Obviously this woman is me and the lipstick thing is just weird. What can I say? It\u2019s something to do with my mum and putting on a brave face. No one sees it. I am alone, but it is a sign I am moving between the inner and the outer world. That is what writing is, an oscillation between the internal and the external. (<strong>Tip 1:</strong> find your own equivalent of the lipstick. It\u2019s the beginning.)</p> <p>When we ask, \u201cWhat are the conditions necessary for women to write in?\u201d we are really asking, \u201cWhat are the conditions necessary for women to think in?\u201d It\u2019s that simple.

You have to be good. And you are only as good as the last piece you wrote. Women need to front it out. Panic inside? Impostor syndrome?

And fast.)</p> <p>More and more, I see that what holds women back \u2013 besides money and social class, which of course remain the biggest factor within a media dominated by privately educated men \u2013 is something we <em>can</em> do something about. And that is this dreadful need to be liked. I wouldn\u2019t advise anyone who wants to be liked to write for a living. Some may love you, but a woman with an opinion is deemed unlikable.

Children. Is it possible to write and have children? Yes, of course it is. Is it possible to write as much as you would like and have children? I don\u2019t know. I had a child long before I became a journalist. Writing can wrap around childcare. Or, circumstances mean it doesn\u2019t happen, or that writing is more important than reproduction.

We hear again and again that in the US and the UK, to have any hope of slowing the climate emergency, we need to cut down on meat by 90% and dairy by 60%.

He knows this makes him sound like a hypocrite, but that kind of honesty is realistic. The vegan accounts I follow on Instagram are funny and open to people who are interested in what vegans are doing, even if they aren\u2019t doing it themselves.

Last week, John le Carr\u00e9 found himself was on the receiving end of sharp words from the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove. \u201cHe is so corrosive in his view of MI6 that most professional Secret Intelligence Service officers are pretty angry with him,\u201d <a href=\"https://civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/ex-m16-boss-says-john-le-carr%C3%A9s-portrayal-spy-agency-corrosive\" title=\"\">Dearlove told the Cliveden literary festival</a>, explaining that he found Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s work to be nihilistic and cynical. \u201cIntelligence organisations are based on trust between colleagues. His books are exclusively about betrayal.\u201d</p> <p>Dearlove follows Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick in grumbling that an imaginary version of something invented by a writer with the purpose of entertaining people lacks realism. For her, police corruption in <em>Line of Duty</em> was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/24/met-chief-cressida-dick-outraged-line-of-duty-corruption-portrayal\" title=\"\">an outrage</a>; for Dearlove, it\u2019s the idea that spies might betray one another. I look forward to a wave of dramatically inert stories about well-behaved police officers and trusting spies working together pleasantly and without event. The wait, I\u2019m sure, will be more than worth it.</p> <p>Still, it gave Le Carr\u00e9 the opportunity to respond with fantastic acidity. Writing in the <em>Times</em>, he said he doubted that senior professional intelligence officers were angry with him, because at least a couple of them had told him they were not. He then went for the jugular, criticising Dearlove\u2019s role in the Iraq war, reminding readers that \u201craw, single-source, unchecked MI6 intelligence was being passed to Tony Blair, and presumably to George Bush as well, on a regular basis. And that Sir Richard was instrumental in causing this to happen.\u201d And then, in a sign-off so tart that it would have been right at home on <em>RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race</em>, he thanked Dearlove for all the extra publicity.

The vegan accounts I follow on Instagram are funny and open to people who are interested in what vegans are doing, even if they aren\u2019t doing it themselves. They are not didactic, they are not judgmental, and those qualities, rather than shame, offer the best chance of the shift in habits that we need. Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine: oh, the joy of talking dirty It has been a long, arid, laughter-free 18 months without it, but at last Dear Joan and Jericha is back. The Vicki Pepperdine and Julia Davis comedy has the pair playing terrible agony aunts who shouldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near a problem, even the problems as awful as the gruesome ones they tackle. It\u2019s recorded in Davis\u2019s kitchen and improvised, which gives the added bonus of trying to work out which of them is trying not to laugh and who is egging the other on. Friends are already quoting this new episode to one another, as they did with the first season, and it makes Davis\u2019s recent series Sally4Ever look positively PG. However, as a podcast, it is totally unfit for podcast purposes. I usually listen to them when I\u2019m out walking or on public transport. After the last season, I realised I had to clear the decks for this one and put it on only in private. The sight of me snorting uncontrollably in the park is dangerously close to my own version of Joker, only instead of getting beaten up in an alley, I\u2019ll have been bludgeoned with outrageously filthy gags. It should come with a warning: only suitable for listening in the safety of one\u2019s home. John le Carr\u00e9: forget cloaks \u2013 just watch those daggers As always, literary feuds prove to be as gripping and action-packed as any Real Housewives franchise, rap beef or tabloid-fuelling celebrity spat. Last week, John le Carr\u00e9 found himself was on the receiving end of sharp words from the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove. \u201cHe is so corrosive in his view of MI6 that most professional Secret Intelligence Service officers are pretty angry with him,\u201d Dearlove told the Cliveden literary festival, explaining that he found Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s work to be nihilistic and cynical. \u201cIntelligence organisations are based on trust between colleagues. His books are exclusively about betrayal.\u201d Dearlove follows Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick in grumbling that an imaginary version of something invented by a writer with the purpose of entertaining people lacks realism. For her, police corruption in Line of Duty was an outrage; for Dearlove, it\u2019s the idea that spies might betray one another. I look forward to a wave of dramatically inert stories about well-behaved police officers and trusting spies working together pleasantly and without event. The wait, I\u2019m sure, will be more than worth it. Still, it gave Le Carr\u00e9 the opportunity to respond with fantastic acidity. Writing in the Times, he said he doubted that senior professional intelligence officers were angry with him, because at least a couple of them had told him they were not. He then went for the jugular, criticising Dearlove\u2019s role in the Iraq war, reminding readers that \u201craw, single-source, unchecked MI6 intelligence was being passed to Tony Blair, and presumably to George Bush as well, on a regular basis. And that Sir Richard was instrumental in causing this to happen.\u201d And then, in a sign-off so tart that it would have been right at home on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, he thanked Dearlove for all the extra publicity. Gorgeous. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

They don\u2019t get the psychology of rapid social change and why it makes people uncomfortable. Or they immediately default to [attributing it to] xenophobia and nativism.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the founding editor of <em>Prospect</em><em> </em>magazine, and an Islingtonite who was a Marxist at Eton, Goodhart was undoubtedly a member of the north London metropolitan liberal elite. But in recent years, increasingly at odds with his friends and peers, he has relinquished his membership of what he calls the \u201cliberal tribe\u201d.</p> \n<p>Like an anthropologist with an Oyster card, I begin my search for this tribe outside Waterstones in Hampstead. Home to Sigmund Freud, Michael Foot and Stephen Fry, Hampstead has long been a byword for intellectual, free-thinking liberalism. But how unconstrained is that free-thinking?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This elite's been too emotionally unintelligent about how its priorities aren't shared by many perfectly decent citizens</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>David Goodhart</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I ask a rather severe-looking woman what she thinks of Patel\u2019s speech and she snaps: \u201cOh no, I can\u2019t stand that woman,\u201d and disappears into the bookshop.</p> \n<p>Near the Coffee Cup, a cafe with a history of serving philosophers and politicians, I meet a violinist who\u2019s not prepared to give her name. \u201cWe\u2019re very opinionated,\u201d she says of her fellow denizens. \u201cHampstead is full of highly educated people who don\u2019t hold back.\u201d Are their opinions disproportionately influential? \u201cI wish,\u201d she says, sighing. \u201cIf they were, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d</p> \n<p>A few doors from where the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/edith-sitwell\" title=\"\">Edith Sitwell</a> lived, I encounter a lawyer named Michael Patchett-Joyce, who says he fulfils every category of Patel\u2019s definition. He doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, except when it\u2019s used in a negative sense, in the way the chattering classes and champagne socialism are employed. \u201cChampagne socialism is a pejorative term because there is an inherent oxymoron within that phrase,\u201d says Patchett-Joyce. \u201cIn terms of a liberal elite, I don\u2019t think there necessarily is the same sort of oxymoron. It\u2019s not that far removed from one-nation Toryism, which of course is under big debate at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>That kind of eloquence is not typical of vox-pop contributions, which tend more towards the \u201cI\u2019d get rid of the whole lot of \u2019em\u201d school of opinion. And it raises the question of whether it\u2019s a bad thing to have a liberal elite. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad thing if it\u2019s too powerful and not aware of its own power,\u201d says Goodhart. \u201cThere have to be elites. The metropolitan liberal one is a subset of a bigger elite, and one reason we\u2019re experiencing Brexit and Trump is that this elite has been too emotionally unintelligent about how its priorities are not shared by many perfectly decent citizens.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet metropolitan liberals are not immune to the discomfort of change that Goodhart ascribes to the Somewhere half of the population. Primrose Hill Books has long been a browsing place for the intellectuals who moved to this pretty Georgian neighbourhood in the 1960s and 70s \u2013 people like Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, Claire Tomalin and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ralph-miliband\" title=\"\">Ralph Miliband</a> (father of Ed and David). Stanley Johnson, Boris\u2019s father, used to have an account at the shop.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy parents were university lecturers,\u201d says customer Aileen Harvey. \u201cBut it seems like now everyone is a French or American City worker or a celebrity.\u201d Harvey doesn\u2019t like the way the neighbourhood has gone. She thinks Patel\u2019s label was designed to appeal to the \u201cless well-off and less well-educated by saying \u2018Let\u2019s activate that chip on their shoulder\u2019.\u201d The home secretary was referring to \u201ceducated Labour voters\u201d, she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t live here any more.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jessica Graham, who runs the bookshop with her husband, looks back fondly on the period when Primrose Hill was a centre of intellectual ideas. \u201cWhen I first came here 30 years ago, it was full of academics, journalists and professional people. Everybody cared, read and everybody discussed things. Those kind of people have been priced out of the neighbourhood.\u201d</p> \n<p>She thinks the idea of a liberal elite is an anachronism, partly because in the age of social media and the internet, ideas are less geographically tethered and more widely disseminated. But also due to the effects of high finance.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s more like a global elite,\u201d she says. \u201cHalf the houses round here are empty half the time. They\u2019re second homes for anyone from a Russian oligarch to a movie star.\u201d</p> \n<p>If these international elites don\u2019t fall within Patel\u2019s crosshairs, it may be because their money is welcome and, on the whole, they\u2019re not critical of the government. A characteristic of metropolitan liberals is that they\u2019re outspoken about how things could or should be. Goodhart sees this as a form of narcissism. \u201cThey\u2019re saying: be like us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it. We\u2019ve gone off to good universities and become middle-class professionals, why can\u2019t you do it? Well, actually because lots of people don\u2019t want to do that and can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> \n<p>He may have a point, but the demonisation of the educated classes is a populist trait that is a well-trodden step on the road to demagoguery. It\u2019s easy to mock metropolitan liberals for hypocrisy. After all, they\u2019re often opposed to gentrification, while being the vanguard of gentrifiers. They\u2019re the loudest proponents of multiculturalism while frequently maintaining a distinctly unicultural lifestyle. But even in this age of bovine anti-elitism, it would be the height of stupidity if people who like to visit bookshops come to be seen as the problem.</p>",

Or they immediately default to [attributing it to] xenophobia and nativism.\u201d As the founding editor of Prospect magazine, and an Islingtonite who was a Marxist at Eton, Goodhart was undoubtedly a member of the north London metropolitan liberal elite. But in recent years, increasingly at odds with his friends and peers, he has relinquished his membership of what he calls the \u201cliberal tribe\u201d. Like an anthropologist with an Oyster card, I begin my search for this tribe outside Waterstones in Hampstead. Home to Sigmund Freud, Michael Foot and Stephen Fry, Hampstead has long been a byword for intellectual, free-thinking liberalism. But how unconstrained is that free-thinking? I ask a rather severe-looking woman what she thinks of Patel\u2019s speech and she snaps: \u201cOh no, I can\u2019t stand that woman,\u201d and disappears into the bookshop. Near the Coffee Cup, a cafe with a history of serving philosophers and politicians, I meet a violinist who\u2019s not prepared to give her name. \u201cWe\u2019re very opinionated,\u201d she says of her fellow denizens. \u201cHampstead is full of highly educated people who don\u2019t hold back.\u201d Are their opinions disproportionately influential? \u201cI wish,\u201d she says, sighing. \u201cIf they were, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d A few doors from where the poet Edith Sitwell lived, I encounter a lawyer named Michael Patchett-Joyce, who says he fulfils every category of Patel\u2019s definition. He doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, except when it\u2019s used in a negative sense, in the way the chattering classes and champagne socialism are employed. \u201cChampagne socialism is a pejorative term because there is an inherent oxymoron within that phrase,\u201d says Patchett-Joyce. \u201cIn terms of a liberal elite, I don\u2019t think there necessarily is the same sort of oxymoron. It\u2019s not that far removed from one-nation Toryism, which of course is under big debate at the moment.\u201d That kind of eloquence is not typical of vox-pop contributions, which tend more towards the \u201cI\u2019d get rid of the whole lot of \u2019em\u201d school of opinion. And it raises the question of whether it\u2019s a bad thing to have a liberal elite. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad thing if it\u2019s too powerful and not aware of its own power,\u201d says Goodhart. \u201cThere have to be elites. The metropolitan liberal one is a subset of a bigger elite, and one reason we\u2019re experiencing Brexit and Trump is that this elite has been too emotionally unintelligent about how its priorities are not shared by many perfectly decent citizens.\u201d Yet metropolitan liberals are not immune to the discomfort of change that Goodhart ascribes to the Somewhere half of the population. Primrose Hill Books has long been a browsing place for the intellectuals who moved to this pretty Georgian neighbourhood in the 1960s and 70s \u2013 people like Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, Claire Tomalin and Ralph Miliband (father of Ed and David). Stanley Johnson, Boris\u2019s father, used to have an account at the shop. \u201cMy parents were university lecturers,\u201d says customer Aileen Harvey. \u201cBut it seems like now everyone is a French or American City worker or a celebrity.\u201d Harvey doesn\u2019t like the way the neighbourhood has gone. She thinks Patel\u2019s label was designed to appeal to the \u201cless well-off and less well-educated by saying \u2018Let\u2019s activate that chip on their shoulder\u2019.\u201d The home secretary was referring to \u201ceducated Labour voters\u201d, she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t live here any more.\u201d Jessica Graham, who runs the bookshop with her husband, looks back fondly on the period when Primrose Hill was a centre of intellectual ideas. \u201cWhen I first came here 30 years ago, it was full of academics, journalists and professional people. Everybody cared, read and everybody discussed things. Those kind of people have been priced out of the neighbourhood.\u201d She thinks the idea of a liberal elite is an anachronism, partly because in the age of social media and the internet, ideas are less geographically tethered and more widely disseminated. But also due to the effects of high finance. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a global elite,\u201d she says. \u201cHalf the houses round here are empty half the time. They\u2019re second homes for anyone from a Russian oligarch to a movie star.\u201d If these international elites don\u2019t fall within Patel\u2019s crosshairs, it may be because their money is welcome and, on the whole, they\u2019re not critical of the government. A characteristic of metropolitan liberals is that they\u2019re outspoken about how things could or should be. Goodhart sees this as a form of narcissism. \u201cThey\u2019re saying: be like us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it. We\u2019ve gone off to good universities and become middle-class professionals, why can\u2019t you do it? Well, actually because lots of people don\u2019t want to do that and can\u2019t do that.\u201d He may have a point, but the demonisation of the educated classes is a populist trait that is a well-trodden step on the road to demagoguery. It\u2019s easy to mock metropolitan liberals for hypocrisy. After all, they\u2019re often opposed to gentrification, while being the vanguard of gentrifiers. They\u2019re the loudest proponents of multiculturalism while frequently maintaining a distinctly unicultural lifestyle. But even in this age of bovine anti-elitism, it would be the height of stupidity if people who like to visit bookshops come to be seen as the problem.",

      "bodyText": "Here is Louise Taylor\u2019s report from the Riverside ... Thanks for joining me. My level of chat ... Neville did not look too happy after the game ... Here is Beth England scoring for England Obviously, there is plenty more football to come today. Why not move over to our LIVE clockwatch, which I will be manning from 4pm (someone is currently manning it, don\u2019t worry). You can see that England miss Ellen White, who is a proper finisher and it far more ruthless than Taylor. She could be back for the next round of international friendlies, which would be a welcome boost for everyone. A pretty positive spin there from the lad Phil. He is relying on luck rather than competence it seems. Neville: \u201cYou know what? When we went to Norway and Belgium you thought that\u2019s nowhere near the level but that\u2019s the performance of a top, top team and we got punished for two lapses in concentration. We\u2019re in a period where things aren\u2019t going for us, when maybe they were 12 months ago. \u201cI can look my players in the eye and they can look me in the eye and say they had a good game of football today. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve to lose.\u201d Neville is on on giving the players a talking to on the pitch. One can only assume he\u2019s explaining that scoring goals matters. The negatives: Earps\u2019 error, the inability to stop the cross for the second and some pretty pathetic finishing. The positives: England\u2019s impact off the bench, ability to create chances If we\u2019re being positive, it\u2019s a chance for England to learn the valuable lesson that if you do not take your chances, you will be punished. They had so many chances in the first half they should have won it at a canter but instead they were punished by Debinha\u2019s two finishes. It\u2019s five games without a win for England now and another underwhelming performance as Neville continues to ponder what his best team is. 90 mins: Bloomin\u2019 heck! Greenwood causes panic in the box with a cross from the left which goes over England and the onrushing goalkeeper, allowing Staniforth to head it towards an empty net, only to see Barbara backtrack to claw it away. 88 mins: Brazil are just looking to kill time here, knocking it around as slowly as they can to ensure they keep possession. 85 mins: Mead chips the ball over the Brazil defence, England runs onto it and dives to make contact with the ball but it just glances off the top of her head and into Barbara\u2019s arms. 84 mins: Bronze wins England a corner. Greenwood whips in the set-piece right on top of the goalkeeper who does well to get a fist on it under her own crossbar to clear the danger. 82 mins: England scoring for England is what we all want to see. She took her first chance after Taylor spent the game fluffing her lines. The substitution makes the difference as Houghton hits a long, straight ball into the box for England to attack and the striker picks out the top corner from around the penalty spot. 79 mins: Mead does well once again down the left but her final product falls well short as she dinks it, once again, into Barbara\u2019s hands. 77 mins: Brazil are just passing it around some lethargic England players. Sue Smith on commentary says it\u2019s \u201cflat\u201d and it really is. Daly lifts a cross straight into the goalkeeper\u2019s arms. Nothing to see here. England 0-2 Brazil 75 mins: England are currently going through the motions in a match they have lost. What a spectacle. 73 mins: England is coming on for England, which is a fine moment for headline writers. 71 mins: It\u2019s a good job England sold all of those tickets to the Germany game before this performance as it would not encourage many to attend. A couple more changes for Brazil as Milene and Thaisa come on. 69 mins: England are paying for the price for having a complete inability to finish in this game. These recent friendlies have been poor from England and despite looking like they should be ahead in this game, they now face an uphill struggle to get anything from this. A low cross from the right finds its way to Debinha in the centre who strikes it first time from the six yards out, it deflects off Bronze and loops over Earps. Greenwood really should have done more to stop the cross. What a miserable day this is for England. 65 mins: Daly goes into the book after losing the ball and trying to make up for it by diving into a challenge with Zaneretto but getting nowhere near the ball. 63 mins: Daly flicks a pass onto Taylor who heads the ball ahead of her but it just gets too far away from the striker and Barbara comes out to smother it. 61 mins: England have barely created a chance since the break, which is surprising considering they had eight shots in the first half. Brazil almost worked an opening for a second as Debinha glides past Williamson following a quick one-two, only for Bronze to read the danger and nip in. Taylor clips the ball into Parris\u2019 feet but she cannot control it and her first touch ends up in Barbara\u2019s hands. England 0-1 Brazil 59 mins: It looks like Parris has replaced Nobbs in the centre and Daly is now on the right wing. 57 mins: It\u2019s fantastic that England want to play out from the back but it is reliant on them moving the Brazil players around, if there\u2019s no movement and the passing takes place at a snail\u2019s pace, then they will not cause issues. The last two attacks have come from the full-backs finding space going round the outside. Nobbs exits and Daly comes on. 55 mins: Brazil have looked brighter since making their half-time changes and England have just failed to raise their game to match the increased intensity. 53 mins: A corner is lifted into the box by Luana and Ludmila wins the header at the front post but flicks it over. England look a little panicked now. Down the other end, Nobbs hits a tame shot from the edge of the area straight at the goalkeeper. 51 mins: England need to get back to how they were playing in the first half after that blow. England are punished for their inability to score, as Tamires turns Parris inside and out on the left flank before chipping a cross ion Debinha\u2019s head, allowing her to direct the ball on goal and it goes under Earps who should have done better. 47 mins: Walsh lifts the ball out to Mead who lays it off to Greenwood to lift a high cross into the box, it\u2019s headed down by a defender straight into the path of Bronze who hits the bouncing ball straight at Barbara. Here we go again! England are unchanged, while Brazil have brought on Maria, Ludmila, Monica. Marta one of the players to depart. \u201cNow I want to see goals. We should be three or four goals up!\u201d Neville tells it how it is. Here is Beth Mead doing extremely well until the finish ... According to the stats, England have enjoyed 61% possession, which I feel is remarkably low. From that they have mustered three shots on target to Brazil\u2019s one. There were 31,000 tickets sold for today\u2019s game. Carly Telford is surprised people are interested in the England team after the World Cup. The hosts really should be winning, if not out of sight. England have completely dominated the opening 45 minutes and had more than enough chances to be ahead but have lacked composure in front of goal. Brazil have no tested Earps and have looked relatively awful at the back. 45 mins: Just one minute added on. 44 mins: Walsh shoes what she is capable of with a cross-field ball to Parris who just can\u2019t catch it but it was a lovely pass. 42 mins: Nobbs whacks a low cross towards Mead who can only get her studs onto it. The winger complains she was pulled back but the referee isn\u2019t interested. Jonathan Pearce and Sue Smith are currently discussing what they drank last night, which is a sign that nothing has happening the last couple of minutes. No brandy for me, sadly. 40 mins: Walsh\u2019s passing ability and Scott\u2019s desire to break up play seems like a good combination but it is the latter having the most influence on this game, which is a concern considering how much of the ball England have had. England 0-0 Brazil 38 mins: Mead gets the ball stuck under her feet and but digs it out and goes through Giovanna who pulls her back for no reason whatsoever. Greenwood once again whips in the free-kick, it\u2019s a lovely cross but Tamires clears it for a throw. 36 mins: Greenwood whips in the cross after some funky set-piece work - it is cleared but the referee blows for a foul on the goalkeeper. What a waste of two minutes. 34 mins: Nobbs sends Parris to chase a ball into the corner, she reaches it but is then tripped by Marta, who is harshly booked for the challenge. 32 mins: Nobbs, who has failed to into the game, tries to beat a couple of players on the edge of the area but is crowded out and Brazil get the ball quickly down the other end where a dangerous cross is put into the box but it defeats everyone. 30 mins: England have dominated the match here but have lacked the requisite composure in front of goal. Brazil\u2019s defence looks pretty ropey, to be honest, too. If England do not win this it will be concerning. 28 mins: Parris sends a through ball, which a defender mishits and it goes through for Taylor to latch onto but the striker takes too many touches when one-on-one and eventually tries to chip Barbara but sends it well over. I do not have a clue how England are not ahead in this. 26 mins: England really should be in front as Mead collects a long diagonal pass from Houghton, darts into the box, beats two defenders but then passes the ball beyond the far post from just five yards out. Not a great finish from Mead but some wonderful play to get into that position. 24 mins: Bronze sends Formiga over with an outstretched leg. The resulting free-kick is whipped into the box by Marta but Greenwood is first to it. England 0-0 Brazil 22 mins: England in red against Brazil in their traditional yellow and blue reminds me of the early 1990s, when life seemed so much simpler. Someone not enjoying life right now is Parris who is caught on the top of her foot by 41-year-old Formiga. The England player gets to her feet and seems OK, which is good news. 20 mins: More troubles at the back for Brazil as Barbara keeps hold of the ball for too long before toe poking it straight to Parris while under pressure from Taylor. Fortunately for Brazil danger is averted when the winger\u2019s cross is diverted behind. 18 mins: Brazil work their way into the box and the ball is laid off into the path of Debinha who fires a shot towards the bottom corner only to see Houghton stood in the perfect position to whack it clear. 16 mins: Brazil are almost caught out at the back when Parris drills at shot at goal which Barbara palms out into the danger area, only for a defender to pass it back to the goalkeeper for some reason or other. In the end they do get the ball clear but they are lucky to do so. 14 mins: Taylor finds space down the left and sends a low cross into the box but Barbara gobbles it up. Some nice play between Nobbs and Parris results in a cross into the box being knocked down by Mead to Taylor but Brazil react and clear. England 0-0 Brazil. 12 mins: Parris is the next to test Barbara, powerfully heading a deep cross towards goal at the back post but it\u2019s straight at the goalkeeper. Still goalless at the Riverside but England are certainly on top. 10 mins: NO GOAL! Mead chips in a cross from the right, which Taylor nudges it towards goal from six yards out, Barbara saves but the striker not knocks in the rebound, only to see the flag aloft. It is a tight call but just about right. 8 mins: Luana lumps a free-kick into the England box but it goes over everyone in a yellow shirt and the England defence mop up at the back post. England are trying to play out from the back and Brazil are letting them and it almost costs them, as the hosts get the ball up the pitch to Mead, who gets round the full-back and sends a cross for Parris to attack but Tamires just beats her to it and turns it behind for a corner which comes to nothing. 6 mins: Some direct play from England ends with Parris knocking a high ball down for Taylor but Barbara comes off her line quickly and removes the danger 25 yards from her own goal before Taylor can pounce. 4 mins: Walsh strikes a shot with plenty of zip from a central position around 20 yards but she drags it just wide. Down the other end Zaneratto dribbles into the box and finds enough space to dig out a shot but it\u2019s straight at Earps who takes it easily. 2 mins: England are on the front foot and Brazil have barely had a touch so far. Parris almost gets played in but the defence just about cut it out before the situation gets too dangerous. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble. Lots of flags being waved around the stands, which are filling up nicely. Lucy Bronze collects a couple of awards from Baroness Campbell and her family. Neville has been committed to tinkering since the World Cup, which has included four games without a win. This team looks pretty strong to be fair and England\u2019s recent history has been impressive. Jordan Nobbs is back, which is good. Suzanne Wrack wrote about her return. What can we learn about England today? Will Houghton and Williamson be a good partnership? How much was Nobbs missed during the World Cup? Is Earps ready to be the No 1? I will almost certainly not have the answers by the end but we can all look out for them. This England team is inspirational, according to Big Phil. Phil Neville looks pretty happy to be in Middlesbrough. England: Earps; Bronze, Houghton, Williamson, Greenwood; Nobbs, Scott, Walsh; Parris, Taylor, Mead Brazil: Barbara; Giovanna, Kathellen, Erika, Tamires; Debinha, Luana, Formiga, Marta; Chu, Bia Zaneratto Will will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Phil Neville: Phil Neville has praised the solidarity that exists between women athletes after seeing his England squad watch the heroics of Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson. \u201cWhat I find really inspiring is that Monday night was the Manchester United v Arsenal game for instance, that\u2019s on in the background and we all have a laugh about it; Spurs v Bayern on Tuesday; the minute that a female athlete comes on, Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson, they all get excited because that is their inspiration,\u201d Neville said. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting together. That\u2019s inspiring for them. The gold medal that KJT won \u2013 they have a different sensation. My sister [former England netball head coach Tracey Neville] came to camp on Tuesday \u2013 there is a connection between women in sport, a \u2018we\u2019ve broken down these barriers ourselves and we\u2019re going to take on the world ourselves and when one of us wins we all win\u2019. \u201cThat is the connection I have found over the last 18 months. Chelsea can win the league title in the men\u2019s game and the Chelsea girls are happy. But when England win at netball, they all celebrate together. It\u2019s almost like a pack of wolves fighting together.\u201d Suzanne Wrack\u2019s full piece is here. Kick-off at the Riverside: 12.45pm BST.",

Welcome to live coverage of Tottenham\u2019s attempt to get back on the horse after their bizarre humiliation against Bayern Munich. There\u2019s an end-of-days feel around Spurs at the moment, with the manager and half the squad reportedly keen to do one. A blissful five-year relationship, one that almost everybody envied and admired, was not supposed to end like this.</p> <p>Spurs could end the weekend in third place, so <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976%E2%80%9377_Football_League\">it\u2019s not exactly 1976-77 revisited</a>. For that to happen, they first need to win a Premier League game away from home for the first time since January. </p> <p>In that time they have drawn two and lost seven, a run that becomes even harder to explain given their form before that. When Harry Winks scored an injury-time winner at Fulham on 20 January, it gave Spurs their 15th victory in the previous 19 away games. </p> <p>Their opponents, Brighton, have played better than the table suggests, and with a bit more luck they could be in fifth or sixth place rather than 16th. </p> <p>They <em>are </em>sixth in one table - the one that tells you which side has played the most passes this season. Brighton\u2019s football, though undeniably confident and impressive, has had a kind of sexless beauty. They have struggled to create chances, and only Newcastle and Watford have scored fewer goals. Spurs can rest easy; they won\u2019t be conceding seven today.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 12.30pm BST.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-05T11:07:09.428Z\">at 12.07pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Barney Ronay\u2019s match report has arrived, so I\u2019m off for a nap before my next liveblog. Bye! Here\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino \u201cHugo is in hospital now. The club will communicate what has happened, but there is no good news. It had a massive emotional impact on the team, and we lost a goal as well. We tried to find a solution in the second half, a different way to play, but it was impossible. We are living a tough moment. We need to keep going and stick together. I feel sorry for the fans. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy \u2013 after five and a half years this is the first tough moment we are living. It\u2019s new for all of us. I hope the pressure comes on me, not the players. We cannot underestimate this kind of situation, but in the times that are not so good there is always the possibility to make things stronger.\u201d It feels like these are end times for Spurs and Mauricio Pochettino. But there\u2019s an unpleasant bloodlust in the way the situation is being discussed. There\u2019s an undercurrent of glee about the whole thing. Let\u2019s force the issue so that he loses his job and we get our BREAKING NEWS fix, then we can move onto the next one. You want a P45, Ole Gunnar? How about you, Unai? Marco? What about you, Pep? You\u2019ll get yours one day. There\u2019s no more news on Hugo Lloris, who was taken to hospital after suffering a hideous elbow injury when Brighton scored their first goal. The replays of the incident, apparently, were extremely grim. \u201cAs much as I like Calum Robinson and David McGoldrick,\u201d begins Eoin Jones, \u201csurely Mick McCarthy needs to bring Connolly into the Irish senior team for the upcoming qualifiers after that performance?\u201d I guess he\u2019ll want to manage him carefully, but it won\u2019t be long because he looks a serious prospect. He reminds me a bit of Coventry-era Robbie Keane in his relentless movement, his cocky, imaginative finishing and his general Irishness. Post-match interviews Aaron Mooy \u201cI thought we played really well, with intent from the start. We\u2019ve played well in most of the games this season but the final touch wasn\u2019t there. Today we put it all together. It\u2019s a perfect day for everyone. Aaron Connolly \u201cI can\u2019t really put it into words. It\u2019s a dream come true. I\u2019ve been watching the Premier League since I was four or five, I watch Premier League Years all the time, and to be playing in it and scoring in it is indescribable.\u201d There are some intriguing 3pm games, including a humdinger at Anfield. You can follow them with Barry Glendenning. Peep peep! Brighton beat Spurs for the first time in 36 years. They played superbly throughout, with the teenage Aaron Connolly two fine goals on his full Premier League debut. But the focus, inevitably, will be on a miserable Spurs performance and a horrible injury to Hugo Lloris. His season is probably over; Spurs\u2019 season isn\u2019t going swimmingly either. 90+2 min There will be three minutes of added time. 90+1 min \u201cControversial opinion: Spurs are not a \u201cnearly\u201d team,\u201d says Yoshua Selvadurai. \u201cThey made 1 (UCL) final, 0 UCL semis, and 0 top 2 EPL finishes.\u201d You\u2019re not looking at the whole pie. (And they finished 2nd in 2016-17.) 90 min Glenn Murray replaces the quietly excellent Dale Stephens. 89 min The Man of the Match is Aaron Connolly. Hard to argue with that in the circumstances, though another Aaron, Mooy, has been brilliant. 88 min Steven Alzate, who has had a good game in midfield, is replaced by Gaetan Bong. Brighton have some really promising young players: Maupay, Trossard, Connolly, Alzate and Murray. 87 min \u201cGreatest near miss of the Wenger era is the 07/08 team,\u201d says Mat Coates. \u201cCrippled by injury in season (Rosicky, Van Persie, Eduardo) and progressively picked clean post season (Hleb, Flamini, Adebayor). Capable of a consistent elan the current crop can only dream of.\u201d Yeah, I think most non-Arsenal fans forget how good that side was. They never really recovered from Birmingham, did they. 86 min Lucas Moura forces another good save from Ryan, this time with a fierce shot towards the bottom corner from 25 yards. Ryan got down very smartly and stretched to his left to beat it away. Lucas Moura has been great since coming on. 85 min The impressive Maupay controls a cross from the right and selflessly tees up Gross, who shoots straight at Gazzaniga from 17 yards. 83 min Mat Ryan makes a fine close-range block from Lucas Moura, who suddenly injected a bit of speed and quality into Spurs\u2019 play. He ran onto Lamela\u2019s lobbed pass, turned his man in the area and struck a shot that hit the outrushing Ryan. 81 min \u201cMy favourite nearly team is probably that Parma side from the mid-late \u201890s that nearly broke the dominance of Milan and Juventus,\u201d says Jim Bach. \u201cNearly. Crespo, Dino Baggio, Thuram, and a young Buffon...\u201d And, for one season only, our Seba. 80 min Yves Bissouma replaces Aaron Connolly, who scored two accomplished goals on a memorable full debut. He\u2019ll sleep well tonight. 79 min \u201cI spent five years in Brighton and used to steward at the Goldstone Ground, so I am loving this,\u201d says Iain Pearson. \u201cCan I, though, nominate my first love as a nearly team: Celtic in the first half of the seventies. We were at the end of our 9-in-a-row run and winning Scottish cups hand-over-fist so this nomination may sound a bit odd until one looks at Europe. \u201cOne European Cup final appearance, two semi-finals (including a penalty-shoot out loss) and one quarter-finals in the European Cup and nothing to add to our single title of 1967. The team sheets of the time included the likes of Jimmy Johnstone, Lou Macari, Kenny Dalglish, Dixie Deans, Billy McNeill, Danny McGrain. All managed by Jock Stein.\u201d 78 min The match is petering out, although Brighton still look dangerous on the counter-attack. For all Spurs\u2019 woes, Brighton have been seriously good today. 77 min \u201cRomania 1994: the greatest of losers,\u201d says Paul Ewart. \u201cMore total than Danish Dynamite + Hagi, gloriously tabbing his way through matches.\u201d They were entirely wonderful (I wish somebody would write a book on them), but I\u2019d argue Denmark were a more complete package, and they did it at two tournaments. Romania will definitely be on the list if I ever get to write the Joy of Six: Loose Cannons (see also: Zeman\u2019s Foggia and Chris Nicholl\u2019s Southampton). 75 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Mundane Protest. \u201cSurely the obvious cause for Spurs\u2019 dismal start is that four of the most important players in their first XI have been allowed to enter their final year of contract, meaning 4/11ths of the team isn\u2019t committed to the club and the other half knows that and is justifiably miffed. Under Ferguson, say, can you imagine any player, no matter how good, showing that level of indifference to the club and not being immediately sold?\u201d Well, it happened with Ronaldo and Keane. But they were the best player in the team on each occasion, so I take your point. 74 min Maupay is poised to head Brighton 4-0 ahead when Alderweireld gets the slighest touch on the ball. 73 min Son is replaced by Lucas Moura. 71 min Kane misses an excellent chance, lifting a left-footed shot over the bar from 10 yards after turning back inside Burn. 69 min Son, in the six-yard box, fresh-airs an attempted shot on the turn. 67 min Connolly plays with a lovely arrogance, particularly in his finishing. He almost scored with a confident lob at Newcastle the other week, and both goals today have had a touch of class. 66 min \u201cNot a team,\u201d says Niall Mullen, \u201cbut a video of Jimmy White\u2019s 90\u2019s snooker career has replaced the word \u2018nearly\u2019 in the dictionary.\u201d I think we did a Joy of Six on this once. (Edit: yes, we did.) This is some full debut for Aaron Connolly. He\u2019s been a pest all day and now he\u2019s scored his second goal. The move started when he made a fine run from centre to left to receive Dunk\u2019s long pass. Then he cut back inside, shifted the ball away from Alderweireld and cracked a superb low shot into the far corner from 15 yards. What a terrific goal this is, from a fine young player. 63 min Mooy, who has been superb on the left of Brighton\u2019s midfield diamond, draws a foul from Sissoko on the left wing. Gross goes for goal from a ludicrous angle, whipping a brilliant disguised effort off the top of the crossbar. That\u2019s their 15th attempt on goal; Spurs have had two. 62 min \u201cSpurs made the European final last year, ahead of any expectations, moved into their new stadium and finally spent money on players,\u201d says Zach Neeley. \u201cWhy are they so disaffected?\u201d All things move toward their end. It\u2019ll make a good book when the dust has settled. There are tens of reasons; I suspect the biggest is a vague, self-perpetuating inertia. 61 min Brighton try the Beckham/Scholes corner, or rather the Mooy/Stephens, for the second time in the match. This time Stephens belts his volley over the bar. 57 min Stephens is booked for blocking Lamela from taking a quick free-kick. Lamela booted the ball against Stephens to ensure he\u2019d be booked. 56 min \u201cOn the subject of nearly teams,\u201d says Andrew Champney, \u201cI have fond memories of Roy Evans\u2019 Liverpool side.\u201d Who doesn\u2019t? 55 min Burn\u2019s wallop from the edge of the area is blocked by Winks. Dier was booked for blocking Connolly off the ball. Is VAR allowed to recommend first yellow cards? 53 min Connolly goes down after an off-the-ball incident with Dier. VAR are looking at it while play goes on. 52 min Brighton are sitting much deeper, content to play on the break. It\u2019s a slightly risky tactic but you can udnerstand it in the circumstances. 51 min \u201cAre we a couple of centre-back injuries at either end of the East Lancs Road away from all 20 PL clubs scrapping for fourth?\u201d says Gary Naylor. Arsene knows knew.\u201d Once upon a time it was always like this. 50 min Sissoko overhits a pass to Son, but it runs through to Davies on the left. His low cross is kicked behind by the stretching Webster. This is better from Spurs. 48 min Here\u2019s Mark Hooper. \u201cNice to see the Brighton subs bench paying tribute to Abbey Road by spelling out the drum line from Come Together: 3 Bong, 8 Bissouma, 14 Balogun, 16 Jahanbakhsh.\u201d 47 min Spurs win a corner. They already look livelier than in the first half, although they managed that just by taking the kick off. 46 min Peep peep! Spurs begin the second half. They have made a change, with Harry Winks replacing Tanguy Ndombele. That means a switch to a back three, with Eric Dier alongside Aldertonghen. \u201cAh, it isn\u2019t easy watching a nearly team like Spurs do what nearly teams sadly do, which is to wither like leaves under an early frost before harvest,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cAnd yet, nearly teams are in their way much more interesting \u2013 definitely more loved by more neutrals \u2013 than champions. With champions, their flaws are forgotten or re-framed as strengths, or tests of will. Nearly teams? Much more like us; much more, well, human really. Like Ireland at the Rugby World Cup over the years, or the 2014 Liverpool team. Spurs will be one of them, in the Hall of Near Fame. What\u2019s your favourite nearly team, as I know you\u2019ve quite enjoyed Spurs these last few years?\u201d Og dat var Danmark. Half-time chitchat \u201cRob,\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cIs it a crisis yet?\u201d \u201cWatching here in France, they\u2019re showing plenty of replays of the Lloris incident on RMC,\u201d says Marcus Sedgwick. \u201cObviously concerned for their \u2018Frenchie\u2019 as they bizarrely like to say here. It\u2019s a nasty one, not David Busst bad, but nasty.\u201d Peep peep! Brighton lead Spurs 2-0 at the Amex Stadium. The scoreline is pretty flattering - to Spurs, who have played like a team who know it\u2019s over. In their defence, they were stunned by a double blow in the third minute, when Hugo Lloris gave away a terrible goal and suffered a sickening elbow injury in the process. Aaron Connolly, making his first Premier League start, scored the second, and Spurs must be very glad to hear the half-time whistle. 45+5 min Maupay\u2019s driven cutback hits Alderweireld and flashes just wide of the far post. It looked like Maupay had taken the ball out of play, and I suspect it would have been overturned by VAR had they scored. Moments later, Maupay\u2019s swooshing 25-yarder is well held by Gazzaniga. 45+3 min I knew Spurs would miss Serge Aurier. 45+1 min There will be seven minutes of added time because of the injury to Hugo Lloris. 45 min \u201cThat man, with the lovely hair, presenting Gazzetta,\u201d says Stephen Bassett. \u201cWhatever happened to him?\u201d I know what happened to the lovely hair. 44 min Lamela has a shot kicked off the line by Dunk. Actually, it would have gone wide, but it was still a promising move from Spurs. 42 min Spurs needed a good start after Tuesday. Instead they had an unimaginably miserable first five minutes, with a comedy goal and a hideous injury to Hugo Lloris. They haven\u2019t come close to recovering. 39 min \u201cAt school, one kid decided to vault over the gym horse backwards,\u201d says Duncan Edwards. \u201cHe landed on the wooden floor and his arm was bent the wrong way at the elbow. This being the late 60s, our PE teacher gave him a bollocking.\u201d 37 min Alderweireld overhits a backpass to Gazzaniga; he saves the corner and then lobs it back to Alderweireld, who miscontrols it with his chest and gives away a throw-in. That sums it all up, etc. 36 min Another chance for Brighton! After a nice passing move, Gross\u2019s low cross was steered just wide from 14 yards by Connolly. It\u2019s sad to see Spurs, who have been a model team for so long, playing like this. They\u2019re a complete mess. 35 min Spurs\u2019 heads have gone. Gross\u2019s deflected shot goes just wide of the far post, with Gazzaniga scrambling across his goal. 35 min \u201cIt was such a beautiful summer of cricket; now all you can talk about it is people vomiting with pain,\u201d says John Little. \u201cWhere did it all go wrong?\u201d In fairness, Steve Smith wasn\u2019t exactly ticketyboo when Jofra Archer pinned him. Brighton have been much the better team and now they lead by two. Burn hit a bouncing cross towards the near post, where Connolly got in front of the dozy Davies to flick the ball towards goal from six yards. Gazzaniga made a brilliant save, low to his left, but Connolly reacted first to steer the loose ball into the net. The first effort from Connolly was superb, an improvised flick with his studs as the ball bounced slightly awkwardly. The teenager Aaron Connolly scores on his Premier League debut! 30 min Connolly goes over on the edge of the box after a bit of a shove from Sissoko. Jon Moss says there\u2019s no foul, although he was miles behind play. I think it was a foul, but the original contact was just outside the area. VARman decides it was not a clear and obvious error. 28 min \u201cSo Paulo Gazzaniga takes Lloris\u2019s place?\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cI believe his cousin from the English side of the family used to play in midfield for the Spurs?\u201d That\u2019s as good a reason as any to post this, possibly the greatest intro to a football program. 26 min Lloris is on his way to A&amp;E. Meanwile, Eriksen has Spurs\u2019 first shot on target, a well-struck 25-yarder that is grabbed at the second attempt by Ryan. 26 min \u201cPlayers don\u2019t receive oxygen when injured,\u201d says Dean Moull. \u201cIt\u2019s entonox which is nitrous oxide. Oxygen wouldn\u2019t do much for pain! Nitrous on the other hand...\u201d Ah yes, fair point. I\u2019m with stupid, because I am stupid. 24 min Ndombele makes a vital interception from Montoya\u2019s cutback. Spurs aren\u2019t at the races. Brighton should try to put them away before half-time, because they won\u2019t play this badly after the break. 22 min \u201cI dislocated my elbow playing football 10 years ago after being challenged for a header and landing with my arm outstretched,\u201d says Martin O\u2019Connor. \u201cIt was the most shockingly painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced - I felt the two bone of my forearm pop out of place and back in again - and I have had both my knees reconstructed due to ACL ruptured. I feel for Lloris, he\u2019s likely to be vomiting from the pain right now and will be out for months. To literally add insult to injury, the other team scored while I was writhing in pain and I had spent 2 years trying to get promoted to the team I was playing for that day in my club. As a Spurs fan, it was even more painful than watching them this week.\u201d Vomiting from the pain. Now that\u2019s what I call grim. 20 min An accidental clash of heads between Maupay and Vertonghen, who has been in the wars in this game. He\u2019s receiving a concussion test but seems fine to continue. He has a black eye but I think that\u2019s the same one he\u2019s had for a few weeks. 17 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cYou have to wonder if Spurs are now caught in a cycle of hell. A spiral of bad luck that seems to have no visible exit. Norwich have had more than their fair share of misfortune with injuries but Spurs seem hell bent on creating ever more inventive ways of introducing misfortune into their season.\u201d 15 min Brighton have started really strongly, and are playing with greater urgency than has sometimes been the case this season. Spurs look stunned, both by the goal and that grisly injury to Hugo Lloris. 13 min The first good move from Spurs, with Davies\u2019s through pass towards Eriksen intercepted confidently by Dunk. 10 min A nice set-piece routine from Brighton. Mooy drives a left-wing corner to the edge of the area for Stephens, whose vicious volley is blocked by the head of Vertonghen. I think that was going in. It knocked Vertongen off his feet, but he seems fine now. 8 min After a delay of around five minutes, Hugo Lloris is stretchered carefully off the field. He is still receiving oxygen. The poor bloke, that looks extremely nasty. Paulo Gazzaniga replaces him. 6 min Lloris is still being treated. In fact he\u2019s receiving oxygen, and it looks far more serious than I first thought. Apparently his left arm bent horribly as he landed, and it was sufficiently bad that BT Sport aren\u2019t showing replays. That was a bad error from Lloris. Burn\u2019s booming, overhit cross from the left forced Lloris to backpedal towards his own line. He made a split-second decision to catch the ball instead of pushing it over the bar, but he misjudged where he was in relation to the goalline. As he caught the ball, his momentum took him over the line, so he had to drop it in front of an open goal. Maupay reacted fastest to head it in from a yard. Lloris landed badly and looks in serious pain. He won\u2019t be able to continue. Oh dear lord. Hugo Lloris has given away a goal and injured himself in the process. 2 min Brighton are actually playing a back four, with Burn at left-back and Alzate to the right of centre in a diamond midfield. 1 min Peep peep! Brighton kick off from left to right. The players emerge in the tunnel, most of them looking very serious. Harry Kane has the expression of someone who\u2019s mad to hell and not going to take this anymore. An email! \u201cPleased to make your acquaintance,\u201d writes Quentin Lefarge. \u201cWhat I know about football could be written, but when a manager messes with the full-back/defensive winger position by putting an Eric Dier there or some such the whole team will fail to function.\u201d At ease, Lefarge: Moussa Sissoko will be the right-back. Pre-match reading Graham Potter has addressed Brighton\u2019s goallessness by bringing in an extra striker, the talented Irish teenager Aaron Connolly. Mauricio Pochettino has made four changes from the Spurs team that was plugged 7-2 by Bayern Munich. The big losers are Dele Alli and Harry Winks, who are on the bench, and Danny Rose, who isn\u2019t in the squad at all. Serge Aurier is suspended for repeated galootery, so Moussa Sissoko will play at right-back. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (possible 3-3-2-2) Ryan; Webster, Dunk, Burn; Montoya, Stephens, Alzate; Gross, Mooy; Maupay, Connolly. Substitutes: Button, Bong, Balogun, March, Bissouma, Jahanbakhsh, Murray. Tottenham Hotspur (4-D-2) Lloris; Sissoko, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Davies; Dier; Ndombele, Eriksen; Lamela; Son, Kane. Substitutes: Gazzaniga, Sanchez, Foyth, Winks, Alli, Lucas Moura, Skipp. Referee Jon Moss. Hello. Welcome to live coverage of Tottenham\u2019s attempt to get back on the horse after their bizarre humiliation against Bayern Munich. There\u2019s an end-of-days feel around Spurs at the moment, with the manager and half the squad reportedly keen to do one. A blissful five-year relationship, one that almost everybody envied and admired, was not supposed to end like this. Spurs could end the weekend in third place, so it\u2019s not exactly 1976-77 revisited. For that to happen, they first need to win a Premier League game away from home for the first time since January. In that time they have drawn two and lost seven, a run that becomes even harder to explain given their form before that. When Harry Winks scored an injury-time winner at Fulham on 20 January, it gave Spurs their 15th victory in the previous 19 away games. Their opponents, Brighton, have played better than the table suggests, and with a bit more luck they could be in fifth or sixth place rather than 16th. They are sixth in one table - the one that tells you which side has played the most passes this season. Brighton\u2019s football, though undeniably confident and impressive, has had a kind of sexless beauty. They have struggled to create chances, and only Newcastle and Watford have scored fewer goals. Spurs can rest easy; they won\u2019t be conceding seven today. Kick off is at 12.30pm BST.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cMy earliest memory of dancing,\u201d Marcelino Samb\u00e9 says, \u201cis of being at a community centre for children from troubled families, in Alto da Loba, on the outskirts of Lisbon, where I was born.\u201d We are talking in an office at the Royal Opera House and Samb\u00e9 is sitting down, sometimes wrapping his arms around himself, looking at ease in his body in the way only a dancer can \u2013 with out-of-the-ordinary grace. The director of the Royal Ballet, Kevin O\u2019Hare, announcing Samb\u00e9\u2019s recent promotion to principal dancer, highlighted \u201cthe most wonderful personality\u201d that endears him to audiences and company members alike. Critics are easily slain too: agreeing about his athletically ebullient stage presence. And inevitably, as the second black male dancer to reach the Royal Ballet\u2019s top ranks, he is compared to Carlos Acosta and, like the Cuban star, he has come a long way to reach the heights.</p> <p>\u201cThat community party,\u201d he goes on with his story, \u201cwas a real dancefest \u2013 everyone would bring their own cakes and drinks and we\u2019d dance. I was four years old and remember noticing people\u2019s thrilled faces, watching my rhythmical movements. I was lucky enough to be born into a neighbourhood of African immigrants from Guinea and the Portuguese colonies. I knew dances like kizomba and funana \u2013 all the African rhythms.\u201d </p> <p>It was the community centre\u2019s psychologist who first suggested Samb\u00e9 become a professional. \u201cMaria Rosa was an incredible friend and always took care of me. She said: \u2018You live dance, you breathe dance \u2013 do it. You can do it as a career.\u2019\u201d At the time, he had been watching <em>Fame</em> on television and that clinched it: \u201cI want to be at a school like that,\u201d he thought. (He adds that, later, <em>Billy Elliot </em>would be part of what inspired him to come to England.) He was eight when he auditioned for the National Conservatory in Lisbon and the audition did not, at first, go well: \u201cIt was hilarious. I showed up in tracksuit and trainers, didn\u2019t know what ballet was. The atmosphere was sterile, the other kids were preppy and well prepared. I was nothing of the kind. But I could do the splits and I remember I kept doing the splits repeatedly [he laughs].\u201d The panel was not impressed. \u201cThen came the special moment when they asked us just to dance. They played Scott Joplin and I used that as my inspiration to do African dancing. I remember the freedom of it. I performed what I knew, gave my big smile and the judges were enthused.\u201d The African dancing (and, presumably, the smile) got him in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e22569e9894fa274a949b41b53b3226fbcdaf40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e22569e9894fa274a949b41b53b3226fbcdaf40/0_62_4832_3276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcelino Sambe - principal dancer at the Royal Ballet. photographed at Royal Opera House, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You have to be proud of who you are\u2019: Samb\u00e9 photographed at the Royal Opera House, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shortly after that audition, Samb\u00e9\u2019s father died and the Lisbon Conservatory arranged for Marcelino to be fostered: \u201cI had loving parents but, unfortunately, they could not take care of me. After my dad passed away, it was too much for my mum to take care of me and my sister.\u201d It is clear he would prefer not to elaborate but he dutifully volunteers: \u201cI\u2019m still in touch with my mother, although we\u2019ve grown apart. I\u2019m very aware of how she is doing.\u201d He was fostered by Fernanda and Manuel Barroso and \u201cquickly became a real member of their family. They introduced me to the world of art and music and inspired me to pursue my dreams. My [foster] sister Maria was also at the Lisbon ballet school and helped so much, taught me to stay focused.\u201d </p> <p>Looking at Samb\u00e9 today, he is completely poised. And he tells me something extraordinary. When he is in the wings of the Royal Opera house waiting to go on, he is not the slightest bit nervous. And that is because \u201cI feel very prepared\u201d. Instead he is \u201ccentring\u201d himself. His only fear is of \u201cnot giving everything I have to give.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'I had so much darkness in me\u2026 I have a huge smile but when I'm dark, I'm dark'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2009, Sambe won the Youth America Grand Prix and, in 2010, a gold medal at the USA International ballet competition. He won a scholarship to the Royal Ballet Upper School, graduating into the company during its 2012-13 season. Within four years, he had become a first soloist, and within six, a principal dancer. In the last season, he played Basilio in <em>Don Quixote</em> (directed by Carlos Acosta) and Blue Boy in<em> Les Patineurs </em>and the third movement of Balanchine\u2019s Symphony in C. In April, he graduated from Mercutio to Romeo and was the lead in Crystal Pite\u2019s <em>Flight Pattern</em> (about the refugee crisis). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hofesh-shechter\" title=\"\">Hofesh Shechter</a>, who choreographed <em>Untouchable</em> for the Royal Ballet, a piece in which Marcelino created his own role, sees him as a \u201cquick, adaptable dancer, with a cheeky spark in his eyes\u201d and suggests that what makes him so promising ispraises the \u201ctotal engagement and energy\u201d he brings to his work. But how important does Marcelino himself believe his ebullience is \u2013 and how much does personality affect dance? \u201cOh my God \u2013 totally! You see how someone really is, the seed of who they are on stage \u2013 it\u2019s very exposing. Your heart is open and vulnerable. I feel all my past experiences \u2013 and how I got here \u2013 give layers to my dancing. And dancing has given me so much joy, I want to share it.\u201d</p> <p>Samb\u00e9 does not altogether believe in his own publicity. He wants to set the record straight, to explain what happens when the sun goes in. For just after he became a first soloist in 2017 he got a deep stress fracture in his shin and had to stop for six months. \u201cI\u2019d not been aware of my limitations, I\u2019d thought I was Superman. And my body was like: Hello?! I think you need to reconsider, think about your limitations, learn to grow. There are so many talented boys and men around and you think: I need to keep swimming upstream because, if I stop for a second, I\u2019ll be taken by the stream.\u201d</p> <p>He was devastated at not being able to dance on stage: \u201cI had so much darkness in me. I can be quite dramatic. My personality goes every way: I have a huge smile but when I\u2019m dark, I\u2019m dark.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, he began to see the injury as an opportunity to \u201crefine\u201d his work. There is a first-class health care team at the Royal Ballet and he had a coach, Brian Maloney, a former company dancer, who \u201cgot me up on my feet so patiently. We\u2019d go back to first position. Wrong! Tendue. Wrong!\u201d I thought: how am I ever going to get back to being a light, jumpy dancer? But now, I\u2019m so grateful to the physios who took care of me. And I caught up with who I want to be as a person. I caught up with friends, I worked on my relationships.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06039af926950825af4262486ad4581d69ee6de0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06039af926950825af4262486ad4581d69ee6de0/0_154_2816_3820/737.jpg\" alt=\"Marcelino Sambe in Flight Pattern at the Royal Opera House in May 2019\" width=\"737\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcelino Samb\u00e9 in Crystal Pite\u2019s Flight Pattern at the Royal Opera House in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samb\u00e9\u2019s openness includes a willingness to talk about and celebrate his homosexuality. In 2018, he even did a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZibT1mzd9iI\" title=\"\">video</a> outside the Opera House to promote Gay Pride month: \u201cThey put a flag outside for the first time to mark Gay Pride. It was so important. After all, the history of LGBTQ people here has been immense.\u201d Sometimes, he imagines what it would have been like to be a gay ballet dancer in the Opera House\u2019s past. To my surprise, he admits to feeling \u201cnostalgic about the 60s and 70s \u2013 as if I\u2019d been there in a previous incarnation.\u201d He imagines a time of \u201cmore mystery\u201d and \u201ccomplicated magic\u201d while acknowledging it must have been \u201cpainful for gay men deep in their hearts\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cYou cannot fulfil your potential if you are not allowed to be 100% yourself. You have to be proud of who you are.\u201d He frequently mentions, though he does not name, his partner (they live in north London). Is he a dancer? \u201cNo, a lawyer. We have completely different backgrounds but lead busy lives and have similar schedules and that helps.\u201d</p> <p>Samb\u00e9 reels off a typical Royal Ballet schedule: 10am to 11.45am ballet class. 15-minute break, then five or six hours of rehearsals. He finishes at 6.30pm \u2013 or at 5.30pm if he has a show. He admits it is \u201cexhausting\u201d but explains the Opera House is full of \u201cdancing machines with the stamina needed for full-length ballets\u201d. It matters to him to try and lead a normal life \u2013 and he believes it possible if you \u201ccrack the code\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cMy earliest memory of dancing,\u201d Marcelino Samb\u00e9 says, \u201cis of being at a community centre for children from troubled families, in Alto da Loba, on the outskirts of Lisbon, where I was born.\u201d We are talking in an office at the Royal Opera House and Samb\u00e9 is sitting down, sometimes wrapping his arms around himself, looking at ease in his body in the way only a dancer can \u2013 with out-of-the-ordinary grace. The director of the Royal Ballet, Kevin O\u2019Hare, announcing Samb\u00e9\u2019s recent promotion to principal dancer, highlighted \u201cthe most wonderful personality\u201d that endears him to audiences and company members alike. Critics are easily slain too: agreeing about his athletically ebullient stage presence. And inevitably, as the second black male dancer to reach the Royal Ballet\u2019s top ranks, he is compared to Carlos Acosta and, like the Cuban star, he has come a long way to reach the heights. \u201cThat community party,\u201d he goes on with his story, \u201cwas a real dancefest \u2013 everyone would bring their own cakes and drinks and we\u2019d dance. I was four years old and remember noticing people\u2019s thrilled faces, watching my rhythmical movements. I was lucky enough to be born into a neighbourhood of African immigrants from Guinea and the Portuguese colonies. I knew dances like kizomba and funana \u2013 all the African rhythms.\u201d It was the community centre\u2019s psychologist who first suggested Samb\u00e9 become a professional. \u201cMaria Rosa was an incredible friend and always took care of me. She said: \u2018You live dance, you breathe dance \u2013 do it. You can do it as a career.\u2019\u201d At the time, he had been watching Fame on television and that clinched it: \u201cI want to be at a school like that,\u201d he thought. (He adds that, later, Billy Elliot would be part of what inspired him to come to England.) He was eight when he auditioned for the National Conservatory in Lisbon and the audition did not, at first, go well: \u201cIt was hilarious. I showed up in tracksuit and trainers, didn\u2019t know what ballet was. The atmosphere was sterile, the other kids were preppy and well prepared. I was nothing of the kind. But I could do the splits and I remember I kept doing the splits repeatedly [he laughs].\u201d The panel was not impressed. \u201cThen came the special moment when they asked us just to dance. They played Scott Joplin and I used that as my inspiration to do African dancing. I remember the freedom of it. I performed what I knew, gave my big smile and the judges were enthused.\u201d The African dancing (and, presumably, the smile) got him in. Shortly after that audition, Samb\u00e9\u2019s father died and the Lisbon Conservatory arranged for Marcelino to be fostered: \u201cI had loving parents but, unfortunately, they could not take care of me. After my dad passed away, it was too much for my mum to take care of me and my sister.\u201d It is clear he would prefer not to elaborate but he dutifully volunteers: \u201cI\u2019m still in touch with my mother, although we\u2019ve grown apart. I\u2019m very aware of how she is doing.\u201d He was fostered by Fernanda and Manuel Barroso and \u201cquickly became a real member of their family. They introduced me to the world of art and music and inspired me to pursue my dreams. My [foster] sister Maria was also at the Lisbon ballet school and helped so much, taught me to stay focused.\u201d Looking at Samb\u00e9 today, he is completely poised. And he tells me something extraordinary. When he is in the wings of the Royal Opera house waiting to go on, he is not the slightest bit nervous. And that is because \u201cI feel very prepared\u201d. Instead he is \u201ccentring\u201d himself. His only fear is of \u201cnot giving everything I have to give.\u201d In 2009, Sambe won the Youth America Grand Prix and, in 2010, a gold medal at the USA International ballet competition. He won a scholarship to the Royal Ballet Upper School, graduating into the company during its 2012-13 season. Within four years, he had become a first soloist, and within six, a principal dancer. In the last season, he played Basilio in Don Quixote (directed by Carlos Acosta) and Blue Boy in Les Patineurs and the third movement of Balanchine\u2019s Symphony in C. In April, he graduated from Mercutio to Romeo and was the lead in Crystal Pite\u2019s Flight Pattern (about the refugee crisis). Hofesh Shechter, who choreographed Untouchable for the Royal Ballet, a piece in which Marcelino created his own role, sees him as a \u201cquick, adaptable dancer, with a cheeky spark in his eyes\u201d and suggests that what makes him so promising ispraises the \u201ctotal engagement and energy\u201d he brings to his work. But how important does Marcelino himself believe his ebullience is \u2013 and how much does personality affect dance? \u201cOh my God \u2013 totally! You see how someone really is, the seed of who they are on stage \u2013 it\u2019s very exposing. Your heart is open and vulnerable. I feel all my past experiences \u2013 and how I got here \u2013 give layers to my dancing. And dancing has given me so much joy, I want to share it.\u201d Samb\u00e9 does not altogether believe in his own publicity. He wants to set the record straight, to explain what happens when the sun goes in. For just after he became a first soloist in 2017 he got a deep stress fracture in his shin and had to stop for six months. \u201cI\u2019d not been aware of my limitations, I\u2019d thought I was Superman. And my body was like: Hello?! I think you need to reconsider, think about your limitations, learn to grow. There are so many talented boys and men around and you think: I need to keep swimming upstream because, if I stop for a second, I\u2019ll be taken by the stream.\u201d He was devastated at not being able to dance on stage: \u201cI had so much darkness in me. I can be quite dramatic. My personality goes every way: I have a huge smile but when I\u2019m dark, I\u2019m dark.\u201d Slowly, he began to see the injury as an opportunity to \u201crefine\u201d his work. There is a first-class health care team at the Royal Ballet and he had a coach, Brian Maloney, a former company dancer, who \u201cgot me up on my feet so patiently. We\u2019d go back to first position. Wrong! Tendue. Wrong!\u201d I thought: how am I ever going to get back to being a light, jumpy dancer? But now, I\u2019m so grateful to the physios who took care of me. And I caught up with who I want to be as a person. I caught up with friends, I worked on my relationships.\u201d Samb\u00e9\u2019s openness includes a willingness to talk about and celebrate his homosexuality. In 2018, he even did a video outside the Opera House to promote Gay Pride month: \u201cThey put a flag outside for the first time to mark Gay Pride. It was so important. After all, the history of LGBTQ people here has been immense.\u201d Sometimes, he imagines what it would have been like to be a gay ballet dancer in the Opera House\u2019s past. To my surprise, he admits to feeling \u201cnostalgic about the 60s and 70s \u2013 as if I\u2019d been there in a previous incarnation.\u201d He imagines a time of \u201cmore mystery\u201d and \u201ccomplicated magic\u201d while acknowledging it must have been \u201cpainful for gay men deep in their hearts\u201d. \u201cYou cannot fulfil your potential if you are not allowed to be 100% yourself. You have to be proud of who you are.\u201d He frequently mentions, though he does not name, his partner (they live in north London). Is he a dancer? \u201cNo, a lawyer. We have completely different backgrounds but lead busy lives and have similar schedules and that helps.\u201d Samb\u00e9 reels off a typical Royal Ballet schedule: 10am to 11.45am ballet class. 15-minute break, then five or six hours of rehearsals. He finishes at 6.30pm \u2013 or at 5.30pm if he has a show. He admits it is \u201cexhausting\u201d but explains the Opera House is full of \u201cdancing machines with the stamina needed for full-length ballets\u201d. It matters to him to try and lead a normal life \u2013 and he believes it possible if you \u201ccrack the code\u201d. This involves \u201cfriendship\u201d with everyone (he messages his friends during his short breaks). And he tells himself: \u201cYou\u2019re not the nucleus \u2013 everyone\u2019s life matters.\u201d Samb\u00e9 is proud to be associated with Carlos Acosta, but believes there is a more urgent issue to address than diversity at the Opera House: \u201cWhat matters is that ballet should not just be for elite kids from well-fed families.

      "body": "<p>Building a home in a beautiful rural setting carries with it a special sense of responsibility. This was Simon Fenn and his partner Mitra Cvijanovic\u2019s view from the moment they decided to create a new family home on the Norfolk coast, in the hamlet of Waxham. They were determined to make as light an impact on the surroundings as possible, designing a modern eco-friendly home that would be modest in scale and with the smallest possible carbon footprint. Their super-insulated \u201cbeach shack\u201d is now heated by just two tiny electric radiators and even these are seldom used.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We love how calm the house feels. It\u2019s a complete retreat out of season, where we can get away from it all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen we first moved into the house it was winter and so I went out to the shops and bought us all some thick socks and blankets, because I thought we would be cold,\u201d says Mitra, who works in the finance industry. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t know what to expect, but within a day we were all walking around in T-shirts. No socks, no blankets \u2013 nothing. It was wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>During a regular working week Simon, Mitra and their two sons, Alex, 18, and Sam, 11, are based near Cambridge, where they built a house for themselves some years ago with the help of <a href=\"https://www.molearchitects.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mole Architects</a>. But eventually they decided they wanted another project \u2013 a weekend and holiday house that they could use themselves, but also rent out at times to make sure it was almost fully occupied. They began looking around Cambridgeshire and East Anglia until eventually they found a small bungalow on the coast in a property auction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba2663e6a75094dc6d89ca1ed34ab0a1cfa6000c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2663e6a75094dc6d89ca1ed34ab0a1cfa6000c/0_1164_8984_5391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clean lines: tiles and wood surfaces in the kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clean lines: tiles and wood surfaces in the kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was a prefab bungalow from the 1930s made by Boulton &amp; Paul,\u201d says Simon, an IT consultant. \u201cThey were quite popular back then, but this one was beyond repair. At first we thought we might be able to do something with it, but when we really started looking closely at the building we realised there was no chance. So we began moving towards the idea of a fresh start and a replacement dwelling. Normally you wouldn\u2019t be able to build something new in a place like this, but we knew that we had a good chance because it was replacing the house that was already here.\u201d</p> <p>Simon and Mitra had the old kit house taken apart and recycled. Having already worked with Mole Architects in Cambridgeshire, it was a natural step to ask them to design the family\u2019s very own Shangri-La, a concept that became the name they gave their next home. The design uses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/01/passivhaus-fabric-first-energy-efficiency\" title=\"\">Passivhaus</a> principles, meaning that the house is super-insulated and works to a rigorous low-energy spec, so that very little heating or cooling is needed. Mole Architects \u2013 who have plenty of experience in low-energy, sustainable design \u2013 joined forces with <a href=\"http://www.beattiepassive.com/\" title=\"\">Beattie Passive</a> in Norwich, a construction company that produces energy-efficient, zero-carbon buildings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4db3daad06e77b808e79c66c7cea91180da0536d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4db3daad06e77b808e79c66c7cea91180da0536d/0_280_6619_8274/800.jpg\" alt=\"Let there be heat: triple-glazed windows are massively energy-efficient.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let there be heat: triple-glazed windows are massively energy-efficient.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBeattie are local and were a really good fit,\u201d says Ian Bramwell of Mole Architects. \u201cThey delivered a great result in terms of airtightness and thermal efficiency, but we were still able to design the house we all wanted. Essentially, we have these two rectangular volumes, side by side, and a spine wall down the middle that does most of the structural work without anyone even realising it. But they slide past each other, so that one extends outwards, which was really important in defining the layout of the house.\u201d</p> <p>The four-bedroomed house sits on the footprint of the old and takes some inspiration from the idea of the beach bungalow vernacular, with a twin pitched roofline and its broad verandah. Yet the house is also distinctly modern, with big sheets of triple-glazed sliding glass facing southwards to maximise not just the views over the fields but also the solar energy, which helps to warm the house; in summer the glass windows slide back to allow natural ventilation. The house is built of timber, mostly larch, with thick walls packed with insulation, as well as a ventilation and heat-recovery system.</p> <p>Inside, the yellow front door leads into a central hallway, with two bedrooms to either side, and then the house opens up dramatically at the point where one part of the house begins to slide past the other. Here, there\u2019s a largely open-plan living area with big views and plenty of light. But the layout also allows for an intimate seating area within an alcove, defined by a lower ceiling height. Then there\u2019s a more fluid dining area and, to one side, the kitchen, lightly separated from the rest of the space by a waist-high counter that tops some of the kitchen units.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bb56023cbfe9ca83a11a1c6c133d80236a2b504\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bb56023cbfe9ca83a11a1c6c133d80236a2b504/0_0_6619_8274/800.jpg\" alt=\"Comfort zone: the pitched roof can be seen in this bedroom.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comfort zone: the pitched roof can be seen in this bedroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joinery by two local carpenters lends a warm, organic feel to the spaces, while Simon and Mitra \u2013 who project-managed Shangri-La themselves \u2013 also sourced an engaging mix of contemporary and mid-century furniture and lighting. At one point, before the house was finished, the family thought about putting in a wood-burning stove to keep them warm. But the house is so efficient that Simon and Mitra are now relieved they decided against the idea.</p> <p>\u201cThe Passivhaus principles rely on people being in the building and cooking and doing the usual things, which helps to warm things up naturally,\u201d says Simon, who is now working on plans for a work studio back in Cambridgeshire. \u201cWe always have this very even heat, so the energy use is incredibly minimal, and we just love how calm the house feels. It\u2019s a complete retreat, especially out of season, where we can just get away from it all. We have this wonderful view and the other thing is that you have this fantastic beach down the path where you can walk for miles in either direction. It is a very tranquil place to be.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.shangri-la.house/\" title=\"\">shangri-la.house</a></em></p>",

Their super-insulated \u201cbeach shack\u201d is now heated by just two tiny electric radiators and even these are seldom used. \u201cWhen we first moved into the house it was winter and so I went out to the shops and bought us all some thick socks and blankets, because I thought we would be cold,\u201d says Mitra, who works in the finance industry. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t know what to expect, but within a day we were all walking around in T-shirts. No socks, no blankets \u2013 nothing. It was wonderful.\u201d During a regular working week Simon, Mitra and their two sons, Alex, 18, and Sam, 11, are based near Cambridge, where they built a house for themselves some years ago with the help of Mole Architects. But eventually they decided they wanted another project \u2013 a weekend and holiday house that they could use themselves, but also rent out at times to make sure it was almost fully occupied. They began looking around Cambridgeshire and East Anglia until eventually they found a small bungalow on the coast in a property auction. \u201cIt was a prefab bungalow from the 1930s made by Boulton &amp; Paul,\u201d says Simon, an IT consultant. \u201cThey were quite popular back then, but this one was beyond repair. At first we thought we might be able to do something with it, but when we really started looking closely at the building we realised there was no chance. So we began moving towards the idea of a fresh start and a replacement dwelling. Normally you wouldn\u2019t be able to build something new in a place like this, but we knew that we had a good chance because it was replacing the house that was already here.\u201d Simon and Mitra had the old kit house taken apart and recycled. Having already worked with Mole Architects in Cambridgeshire, it was a natural step to ask them to design the family\u2019s very own Shangri-La, a concept that became the name they gave their next home. The design uses Passivhaus principles, meaning that the house is super-insulated and works to a rigorous low-energy spec, so that very little heating or cooling is needed. Mole Architects \u2013 who have plenty of experience in low-energy, sustainable design \u2013 joined forces with Beattie Passive in Norwich, a construction company that produces energy-efficient, zero-carbon buildings. \u201cBeattie are local and were a really good fit,\u201d says Ian Bramwell of Mole Architects. \u201cThey delivered a great result in terms of airtightness and thermal efficiency, but we were still able to design the house we all wanted. Essentially, we have these two rectangular volumes, side by side, and a spine wall down the middle that does most of the structural work without anyone even realising it. But they slide past each other, so that one extends outwards, which was really important in defining the layout of the house.\u201d The four-bedroomed house sits on the footprint of the old and takes some inspiration from the idea of the beach bungalow vernacular, with a twin pitched roofline and its broad verandah. Yet the house is also distinctly modern, with big sheets of triple-glazed sliding glass facing southwards to maximise not just the views over the fields but also the solar energy, which helps to warm the house; in summer the glass windows slide back to allow natural ventilation. The house is built of timber, mostly larch, with thick walls packed with insulation, as well as a ventilation and heat-recovery system. Inside, the yellow front door leads into a central hallway, with two bedrooms to either side, and then the house opens up dramatically at the point where one part of the house begins to slide past the other. Here, there\u2019s a largely open-plan living area with big views and plenty of light. But the layout also allows for an intimate seating area within an alcove, defined by a lower ceiling height. Then there\u2019s a more fluid dining area and, to one side, the kitchen, lightly separated from the rest of the space by a waist-high counter that tops some of the kitchen units. Joinery by two local carpenters lends a warm, organic feel to the spaces, while Simon and Mitra \u2013 who project-managed Shangri-La themselves \u2013 also sourced an engaging mix of contemporary and mid-century furniture and lighting. At one point, before the house was finished, the family thought about putting in a wood-burning stove to keep them warm. But the house is so efficient that Simon and Mitra are now relieved they decided against the idea. \u201cThe Passivhaus principles rely on people being in the building and cooking and doing the usual things, which helps to warm things up naturally,\u201d says Simon, who is now working on plans for a work studio back in Cambridgeshire. \u201cWe always have this very even heat, so the energy use is incredibly minimal, and we just love how calm the house feels. It\u2019s a complete retreat, especially out of season, where we can just get away from it all. We have this wonderful view and the other thing is that you have this fantastic beach down the path where you can walk for miles in either direction. It is a very tranquil place to be.\u201d shangri-la.house",

Still they looked alarmingly creaky at the back, with a familiar vulnerability to speed between the centre-backs. Brighton\u2019s second arrived with 31 minutes gone. Another goal, another goalkeeping blip. This time it was Dan Burn who curled a lovely ball in behind the centre-backs from the left. Connolly twisted his body with real dexterity and produced a lovely flick on goal that Paulo Gazzaniga could only palm out. The rebound was gleefully gobbled up. It was all Brighton after that, Connolly, Maupay and Aaron Mooy producing some neat combinations. Spurs\u2019 only chance of the half arrived a minute before the break, Son and Kane combining to tee up Lamela for a shot that was blocked. The turquoise away shirts were out five minutes before the restart, shooed early from the dressing room, and they looked more purposeful for a while. But this Brighton team is stuffed with neat little technical players. They snapped back and kept the ball in tight spaces as the air seemed to go out of Tottenham once again. The third goal came from the same left flank, Connolly skipping inside and curling a wonderful low shot into the far corner as the Spurs defence stood and watched. With 72 minutes gone Son was taken off, to boos from the Spurs end. It was simply that kind of day \u2013 but an afternoon of real hope for Potter and the home support.",

We\u2019re told that it was all part of the plan to pull the trigger in the heady climax of a successful African tour.

In the heat of battle and gripped by self-righteous indignation, the royal hand reaches resolutely for the mighty sword of truth and\u2026 waits. And waits.</p> <p>Unless the head of the offending editor(s) can be served up on a plate with the speed to which royal customers are accustomed, the whole business can start to feel like a bad idea. Somebody else\u2019s bad idea, naturally.</p> <p>Eventually, with the Princess of Wales, our legal champions reached a settlement, but by then it was all rather deflating. We were on tour half a world away when the news of our long-awaited vindication came in. It was the middle of the night so I climbed out of my bed in the embassy and tiptoed across the chilly landing to slide the agreed cryptic note under my boss\u2019s door. It didn\u2019t feel like a victory parade and, funnily enough, next day the familiar faces of the press pack wore expressions that were everything except contrite. And they were still just as peskily objective, as they always should be in a democracy of which (to borrow a phrase from Prince Harry\u2019s statement) they are the cornerstone. It occurred to me then that an attack of cold feet at the beginning of the exercise might have been a blessing in disguise.</p> <p>It seems Harry did not have time to cite any actual examples of the offences marching through his mind. It would have been worth the effort to do so, if he were seriously seeking an improved <em>modus vivendi</em> with the press he so obviously despises.</p> <p>Documented evidence of the alleged \u201cruthless campaign\u201d is presumably easy to find and would certainly have silenced some sceptics. Unquestionably, there has been ruthlessness \u2013 and cruelty \u2013 to spare online but the thoroughly modern Sussex digital operation must have been prepared for that, not least psychologically.</p> <p>Accusations of media bullying and prejudice are now being launched from the duchess\u2019s homeland. This can be a learning opportunity for some of her celebrity sisters: royal people have to learn the difference between bullying and criticism, between sarcasm and irony. It\u2019s part of the historic deal that\u2019s overseen by the British media holding to account public figures whose lives are subsidised by (usually) benign British taxpayers.</p> <p>But when royal blood is up and the quarry is in plain view, it\u2019s too late to suggest a nice soothing stroll in the autumn air and a happy review of one\u2019s bountiful royal blessings. Not the least of these being the welcome reality that, as sixth in line, and without anyone minding very much, one could push off to America or Africa or Elton John\u2019s corner of Provence for a life of earnest good works and unassailable eco-virtue.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Win or lose in the courts, Harry and Meghan's royal destiny is still split between two worlds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cFollow your dream\u201d, the duke exhorted young Africans last week. Words for the Sussexes to ponder as they survey the royal future through the sheeting rain over Windsor Great Park. And what a dream: celebrity without apology, Gulfstreams without guilt, Sundays without the Sunday papers and happy anonymity for baby Archie. All this plus gold-plated endorsements from two former US first ladies one of whom, Michelle Obama, hails the duchess \u201ca mould-breaker\u201d.</p> <p>Well, no surprise, breaking British moulds is a risky business, can be messy and is definitely not for the faint-hearted. It\u2019s hardly Dunkirk or even Afghanistan where bachelor Harry earned such respect, but now\u2019s the time for team Sussex to show what it\u2019s really made of.</p> <p>There\u2019s just one small detail to be resolved. Win or lose in the courts, Harry and Meghan\u2019s royal destiny is still split between two worlds, much as they themselves seem split between the progressive idealism of Meghan\u2019s home state and the obstinate reality of Britain\u2019s preference for a comfortably conservative ruling family (and who doesn\u2019t need a bit of comfort in these troubling times?). Diana may have been something in the mould-breaker stakes herself, but she never ducked Balmoral, lectured voters on democracy or borrowed invective more normally found in the White House to communicate with a free and fundamentally friendly press.</p> <p>What\u2019s it to be? Now would be a brilliant time to give Fleet Street and its deplorable insolent tendencies an unequivocal answer. And here\u2019s a respectful suggestion: unclenching your fists will help.</p> <p><em>Patrick Jephson was equerry and private secretary to Diana</em><em>, Princess of Wales from 1988 to 1996.

We\u2019re told that it was all part of the plan to pull the trigger in the heady climax of a successful African tour. So damn the consternation in the palace or the Foreign Office or on the faces of those poor loyal blindsided courtiers \u2013 I bet it felt absolutely great. The justified fury of a reasonable husband driven beyond endurance finds blessed release in legal processes and good old fashioned purgative prose. Applause, surely. I went through something similar with Harry\u2019s mother when we sued the Mirror for sneakily acquired pictures of her working out in a gym. In the heat of battle and gripped by self-righteous indignation, the royal hand reaches resolutely for the mighty sword of truth and\u2026 waits. And waits. Unless the head of the offending editor(s) can be served up on a plate with the speed to which royal customers are accustomed, the whole business can start to feel like a bad idea. Somebody else\u2019s bad idea, naturally. Eventually, with the Princess of Wales, our legal champions reached a settlement, but by then it was all rather deflating. We were on tour half a world away when the news of our long-awaited vindication came in. It was the middle of the night so I climbed out of my bed in the embassy and tiptoed across the chilly landing to slide the agreed cryptic note under my boss\u2019s door. It didn\u2019t feel like a victory parade and, funnily enough, next day the familiar faces of the press pack wore expressions that were everything except contrite. And they were still just as peskily objective, as they always should be in a democracy of which (to borrow a phrase from Prince Harry\u2019s statement) they are the cornerstone. It occurred to me then that an attack of cold feet at the beginning of the exercise might have been a blessing in disguise. It seems Harry did not have time to cite any actual examples of the offences marching through his mind. It would have been worth the effort to do so, if he were seriously seeking an improved modus vivendi with the press he so obviously despises. Documented evidence of the alleged \u201cruthless campaign\u201d is presumably easy to find and would certainly have silenced some sceptics. Unquestionably, there has been ruthlessness \u2013 and cruelty \u2013 to spare online but the thoroughly modern Sussex digital operation must have been prepared for that, not least psychologically. Accusations of media bullying and prejudice are now being launched from the duchess\u2019s homeland. This can be a learning opportunity for some of her celebrity sisters: royal people have to learn the difference between bullying and criticism, between sarcasm and irony. It\u2019s part of the historic deal that\u2019s overseen by the British media holding to account public figures whose lives are subsidised by (usually) benign British taxpayers. But when royal blood is up and the quarry is in plain view, it\u2019s too late to suggest a nice soothing stroll in the autumn air and a happy review of one\u2019s bountiful royal blessings. Not the least of these being the welcome reality that, as sixth in line, and without anyone minding very much, one could push off to America or Africa or Elton John\u2019s corner of Provence for a life of earnest good works and unassailable eco-virtue. \u201cFollow your dream\u201d, the duke exhorted young Africans last week. Words for the Sussexes to ponder as they survey the royal future through the sheeting rain over Windsor Great Park. And what a dream: celebrity without apology, Gulfstreams without guilt, Sundays without the Sunday papers and happy anonymity for baby Archie. All this plus gold-plated endorsements from two former US first ladies one of whom, Michelle Obama, hails the duchess \u201ca mould-breaker\u201d. Well, no surprise, breaking British moulds is a risky business, can be messy and is definitely not for the faint-hearted. It\u2019s hardly Dunkirk or even Afghanistan where bachelor Harry earned such respect, but now\u2019s the time for team Sussex to show what it\u2019s really made of. There\u2019s just one small detail to be resolved. Win or lose in the courts, Harry and Meghan\u2019s royal destiny is still split between two worlds, much as they themselves seem split between the progressive idealism of Meghan\u2019s home state and the obstinate reality of Britain\u2019s preference for a comfortably conservative ruling family (and who doesn\u2019t need a bit of comfort in these troubling times?). Diana may have been something in the mould-breaker stakes herself, but she never ducked Balmoral, lectured voters on democracy or borrowed invective more normally found in the White House to communicate with a free and fundamentally friendly press. What\u2019s it to be? Now would be a brilliant time to give Fleet Street and its deplorable insolent tendencies an unequivocal answer. And here\u2019s a respectful suggestion: unclenching your fists will help. Patrick Jephson was equerry and private secretary to Diana, Princess of Wales from 1988 to 1996.

Even if he wins both cases, which I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll win the phone hacking, I simply don\u2019t understand, why now?</p> <p>\u201cProbably Harry\u2019s just had enough and he\u2019s not going to sit back and take the flak any more and this is his way of flexing his royal muscles.\u201d</p> <p>In his statement released during the royal couple\u2019s tour of South Africa, Harry accused parts of the media of \u201cwaging campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThough [my] action may not be the safe one, it is the right one \u2026 I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d</p> <p>Seward said: \u201cThat was a very personal and angry and inflamed attack. I don\u2019t think it achieved anything apart from detract from the success of their South African tour. That was far too vitriolic and personal. He has the right to compare himself to his mother if he wishes to, but his mother\u2019s situation was very different.\u201d</p> <p>Seward said she suspected Prince Harry\u2019s stand against the media was being urged by his wife. \u201cAmericans are historically extremely litigious and it\u2019s their way of dealing with things. We do it differently, especially members of the royal family who historically have very seldomly sued because it\u2019s just more attention on them. And it drags up dirty washing.</p> <p>\u201cHarry is very volatile, he doesn\u2019t always think the consequences of his actions through. So far, certainly in the first instance [in releasing the statement], the consequence of his actions have been very derogatory and negative.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what her advice would be to the prince in dealing with the press, she said: \u201cI\u2019d say, take a leaf out of his mother\u2019s book and make friends with your enemies. If Diana didn\u2019t like something somebody had written she would get on to them, certainly I\u2019ve experienced that. Then she\u2019d have them round to KP [Kensington Palace] then they\u2019re putty in her hands. But Harry is certainly not going to do that.\u201d</p> <p>The costs of dealing with historical phone-hacking claims, many of them relating to stories published 15 years ago when the British tabloid industry was far more popular and financially successful, now weigh heavily on the already struggling finances of publishers of the Sun and the Mirror, as they deal with payouts and lawyers\u2019 fees costing tens of millions of pounds.</p>",

Even if he wins both cases, which I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll win the phone hacking, I simply don\u2019t understand, why now? \u201cProbably Harry\u2019s just had enough and he\u2019s not going to sit back and take the flak any more and this is his way of flexing his royal muscles.\u201d In his statement released during the royal couple\u2019s tour of South Africa, Harry accused parts of the media of \u201cwaging campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences\u201d. He added: \u201cThough [my] action may not be the safe one, it is the right one \u2026 I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d Seward said: \u201cThat was a very personal and angry and inflamed attack. I don\u2019t think it achieved anything apart from detract from the success of their South African tour. That was far too vitriolic and personal. He has the right to compare himself to his mother if he wishes to, but his mother\u2019s situation was very different.\u201d Seward said she suspected Prince Harry\u2019s stand against the media was being urged by his wife. \u201cAmericans are historically extremely litigious and it\u2019s their way of dealing with things. We do it differently, especially members of the royal family who historically have very seldomly sued because it\u2019s just more attention on them. And it drags up dirty washing. \u201cHarry is very volatile, he doesn\u2019t always think the consequences of his actions through. So far, certainly in the first instance [in releasing the statement], the consequence of his actions have been very derogatory and negative.\u201d Asked what her advice would be to the prince in dealing with the press, she said: \u201cI\u2019d say, take a leaf out of his mother\u2019s book and make friends with your enemies. If Diana didn\u2019t like something somebody had written she would get on to them, certainly I\u2019ve experienced that. Then she\u2019d have them round to KP [Kensington Palace] then they\u2019re putty in her hands. But Harry is certainly not going to do that.\u201d The costs of dealing with historical phone-hacking claims, many of them relating to stories published 15 years ago when the British tabloid industry was far more popular and financially successful, now weigh heavily on the already struggling finances of publishers of the Sun and the Mirror, as they deal with payouts and lawyers\u2019 fees costing tens of millions of pounds.",

      "body": "<p><strong>The book I am currently reading</strong><br>Mostly at this stage I am rereading myself, and finding something marvellous on every page. I\u2019ve just received the advance copies of my new book about Philip Larkin, called <em>Somewhere Becoming Rain</em>. Holding it up to be observed at various angles, I gloat audibly. On a less self-involved note, I should say that I am very much enjoying Douglas Murray\u2019s <em>The Madness of Crowds</em>. And I\u2019ve just read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/25/red-famine-stalins-war-on-ukraine-anne-applebaum-review\" title=\"\">Anne Applebaum\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/25/red-famine-stalins-war-on-ukraine-anne-applebaum-review\" title=\"\">Red Famine</a></em>. Her clarity reminds me of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/aug/14/the-balkan-trilogy-by-olivia-manning-a-fraught-trip-through-wartime-europe\" title=\"\">Olivia Manning</a>.</p> <p><strong>The book that changed my life</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/15/lucky-jim-kingsley-amis-classic\" title=\"\">Lucky Jim</a></em> by Kingsley Amis. I can still quote whole scenes from it. I read it in my early 20s, still a bit young to have fully understood that a book can be simultaneously entertaining and serious. Abruptly I realised that it could be a possible aim, for a writer, to raise a serious point and a laugh along with it.</p> <p><strong>The book I wish I\u2019d written</strong><br>I won\u2019t say that I wish I\u2019d written <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/16/philip-larkin-poems-review\" title=\"\">Larkin\u2019s poems </a>because I remain endlessly glad that he did.</p> <p><strong>The book that had the greatest influence on my writing<br></strong>SJ Perelman\u2019s <em>Westward Ha!</em> I loved the sublime mixture of high style and low content and I thought: yeah, both those doors at once.</p> <p><strong>The book I think is most under/overrated</strong><br>I still think there are paragraphs by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/may-i-have-a-word-about-cliches\" title=\"\">Raymond Chandler </a>that are underrated. But it\u2019s an open question whether he wrote any underrated novels. The most overrated books almost all emerged simultaneously from a single genre: magic realism. I can\u2019t stand it. I always found ordinary realism quite magic enough.</p> <p><strong>The book that changed my mind</strong><br>George Bernard Shaw, his preface to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/14/theatre.stage\" title=\"\">Saint Joan</a></em>. Reading that wonderful stretch of prose started me on the road to a more human version of Christianity: a road I like to think that I am still pursuing.</p> <p><strong>The last book that made me cry</strong><br>It was 20 minutes ago when I was reading Larkin\u2019s poem \u201cTo the Sea\u201d. Sometimes I could swear his memories were mine. Although Australia and Britain have very different beaches, when he was near the sea he always thought it was his element.</p> <p><strong>The last book that made me laugh</strong><br>When Philip Roth died I started reading <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/sep/07/portnoys-complaint-shocking-49\" title=\"\">Portnoy\u2019s Complaint</a></em> again, looking for a quotable line, and couldn\u2019t find one that wasn\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>The book I couldn\u2019t finish</strong><br>I very rarely give up on a book that I\u2019ve really started. Closing a book in disgust half way through the first paragraph doesn\u2019t count.</p> <p><strong>The book I\u2019m most ashamed not to have read</strong><br>That means nothing. I\u2019ve read all the books I thought ought to be read. The books I haven\u2019t read are the books I thought didn\u2019t need to be read.</p> <p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br>Reading to myself, it was a Biggles book by WE Johns, but I can\u2019t remember which one. <em>Biggles Flies East</em>? <em>Biggles Flies West</em>? <em>Biggles Flies West</em> was much better, incidentally. Long before that my mother used to read me <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/dec/29/poem-week-edward-fitzgerald\" title=\"\">The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m</a></em> on the back verandah of our house in Kogarah. She had a natural sense of rhythm, which became a model for the rest of my life as a performer.</p> <p><strong>My comfort read</strong><br>That\u2019s not a concept that I\u2019m familiar with. If reading didn\u2019t make me uncomfortable in one way or another, it would just send me to sleep. I get comfort in other ways. I once wrote a poem called \u201cThe Book of My Enemy Has Been Remaindered\u201d. I\u2019m afraid I still get a big bang out of seeing the books of my rivals being utterly ignored.</p> <p><strong>The book I </strong><strong>give as a gift</strong><br>Larkin again: <em>The Whitsun Weddings</em>.</p> <p><strong>The book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for</strong><br>Since by definition the world will have to still be here in order for anyone to remember my book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/27/tvandradio.society\" title=\"\">Cultural Amnesia</a></em>, then that\u2019s the one. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/06/ep-thompson-unconventional-historian\" title=\"\">EP Thompson</a> talked about history rescuing the past from the \u201cenormous condescension of posterity\u201d. Condescension towards the past has never been more enormous than it is now. My book not only says that we have to remember the past, it presumes that we will, so there is hope in it as well as a warning.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Somewhere Becoming Rain</em> by Clive James is published by Picador (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "The book I am currently reading Mostly at this stage I am rereading myself, and finding something marvellous on every page. I\u2019ve just received the advance copies of my new book about Philip Larkin, called Somewhere Becoming Rain. Holding it up to be observed at various angles, I gloat audibly. On a less self-involved note, I should say that I am very much enjoying Douglas Murray\u2019s The Madness of Crowds. And I\u2019ve just read Anne Applebaum\u2019s Red Famine. Her clarity reminds me of Olivia Manning. The book that changed my life Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis. I can still quote whole scenes from it. I read it in my early 20s, still a bit young to have fully understood that a book can be simultaneously entertaining and serious. Abruptly I realised that it could be a possible aim, for a writer, to raise a serious point and a laugh along with it. The book I wish I\u2019d written I won\u2019t say that I wish I\u2019d written Larkin\u2019s poems because I remain endlessly glad that he did. The book that had the greatest influence on my writing SJ Perelman\u2019s Westward Ha! I loved the sublime mixture of high style and low content and I thought: yeah, both those doors at once. The book I think is most under/overrated I still think there are paragraphs by Raymond Chandler that are underrated. But it\u2019s an open question whether he wrote any underrated novels. The most overrated books almost all emerged simultaneously from a single genre: magic realism. I can\u2019t stand it. I always found ordinary realism quite magic enough. The book that changed my mind George Bernard Shaw, his preface to Saint Joan. Reading that wonderful stretch of prose started me on the road to a more human version of Christianity: a road I like to think that I am still pursuing. The last book that made me cry It was 20 minutes ago when I was reading Larkin\u2019s poem \u201cTo the Sea\u201d. Sometimes I could swear his memories were mine. Although Australia and Britain have very different beaches, when he was near the sea he always thought it was his element. The last book that made me laugh When Philip Roth died I started reading Portnoy\u2019s Complaint again, looking for a quotable line, and couldn\u2019t find one that wasn\u2019t. The book I couldn\u2019t finish I very rarely give up on a book that I\u2019ve really started. Closing a book in disgust half way through the first paragraph doesn\u2019t count. The book I\u2019m most ashamed not to have read That means nothing. I\u2019ve read all the books I thought ought to be read. The books I haven\u2019t read are the books I thought didn\u2019t need to be read. My earliest reading memory Reading to myself, it was a Biggles book by WE Johns, but I can\u2019t remember which one. Biggles Flies East? Biggles Flies West? Biggles Flies West was much better, incidentally. Long before that my mother used to read me The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m on the back verandah of our house in Kogarah. She had a natural sense of rhythm, which became a model for the rest of my life as a performer. My comfort read That\u2019s not a concept that I\u2019m familiar with. If reading didn\u2019t make me uncomfortable in one way or another, it would just send me to sleep. I get comfort in other ways. I once wrote a poem called \u201cThe Book of My Enemy Has Been Remaindered\u201d. I\u2019m afraid I still get a big bang out of seeing the books of my rivals being utterly ignored. The book I give as a gift Larkin again: The Whitsun Weddings. The book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for Since by definition the world will have to still be here in order for anyone to remember my book Cultural Amnesia, then that\u2019s the one. EP Thompson talked about history rescuing the past from the \u201cenormous condescension of posterity\u201d. Condescension towards the past has never been more enormous than it is now. My book not only says that we have to remember the past, it presumes that we will, so there is hope in it as well as a warning. \u2022 Somewhere Becoming Rain by Clive James is published by Picador (\u00a312.99).

Then Cave took the whole process on tour, embarking on an extraordinary series of solo dates in which he mixed song with questions from the audience. That this formerly forbidding bard of lust and brimstone, violence and tenderness, was trading in his artistic aloofness for a purgative communion marked one of the most remarkable evolutions in rock. \u201cNothing can go wrong, because everything has gone wrong,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/16/conversations-with-nick-cave-review-wales-millennium-centre\" title=\"\">he noted in Cardiff</a>.</p> <p>Now there is <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwlU_wsT20Q\" title=\"\">Ghosteen</a></em>, a double album about a wandering spirit in which Cave invokes the gravitas of the late Leonard Cohen and the hoarse, harsh beauty of latterday Scott Walker. You might have thought bereavement might have unleashed a raging, vengeful beast within Cave \u2013 there is a cougar on this album, prowling the perimeter of a California compound, \u201cwith a terrible engine of wrath for a heart\u201d, but it is the sole irruption here of the old, Old Testament Cave.</p> <p>Listening to these 11 songs requires a ready supply of absorbent materials, some rehydration salts \u2013 it is so very sad \u2013 and perhaps a metaphysician on call. Quite apart from the devastation in its recurrent themes \u2013 Jesus in his mother\u2019s arms, blackened butterflies, stairways to heaven, a malevolent, Pied Piper-like sun that steals children away \u2013 <em>Ghosteen</em> is an album about the very nature of what is real and what is not, and who is to judge.</p> <p>Bright Horses, one of the most beautiful songs here, sets loose metaphorical horses of love with \u201cmanes full of fire\u201d into an apocalyptic landscape. But then Cave reins them back in.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re all so sick and tired of seeing things as they are,\u201d he aches, \u201cThe horses are just horses and their manes aren\u2019t full of fire, and the fields are just fields and there ain\u2019t no Lord.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwlU_wsT20Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GwlU_wsT20Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwlU_wsT20Q\">Watch an album trailer for Ghosteen.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Cave, though, feels the continued presence of his son, \u201ca little white shape dancing at the end of the world\u201d. Cave assures us he\u2019s coming home \u201con the 5.30 train\u201d. Why not believe in ghosts? \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with loving something you can\u2019t hold in your hand,\u201d Cave muses, on the title track. And Arthur\u2019s analogue, the Ghosteen, appears from time to time, to say: \u201cI am beside you.\u201d</p> <p>As to where we go when we die, this career-long purveyor of religious imagery doesn\u2019t tackle that directly. \u201cWe are here, and you are where you are,\u201d he puts it movingly, on a song called Fireflies, the first sign of this new album, its <a href=\"https://www.theredhandfiles.com/writing-challenge-skeleton-tree/\" title=\"\">lyrics released via the Red Hand Files</a> a year ago.</p> <p>The album\u2019s vivid cover art, meanwhile, is a kitsch paradise by the artist <a href=\"http://tomduboisart.com\" title=\"\">Tom du Bois</a> in which flamingos frolic and lions lie down with lambs, signalling a radical change of emotional landscape for the Bad Seeds. And yet <em>Ghosteen</em> completes a trilogy of records connected by their sound: <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/17/push-sky-away-nick-cave-review\" title=\"\">Push </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/17/push-sky-away-nick-cave-review\" title=\"\">the Sky Away</a></em> (2013), <em>Skeleton Tree</em> and <em>Ghosteen</em> are all keening, subliminally orchestral works, swirling with electronic mood music; they supersede the rock format and solo piano of previous Bad Seeds or Cave solo works, underscoring the cornerstone presence of violinist Warren Ellis, who also provides revelatory backing vocals.</p> <p>It takes a moment to <a href=\"https://www.nickcave.com/news/ghosteen-the-new-album/\" title=\"\">decipher Cave\u2019s explanation</a> that the songs on Part One are the children, and the songs on Part Two are their parents. These are not two sets of songs sung from generational points of view, but rather, <em>Ghosteen</em>\u2019s second half contains the seeds of its first: the songs of Part One may have been spun off from Part Two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e3dbba73d368788fb744d8cb97daf2ae0ba2ec1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3dbba73d368788fb744d8cb97daf2ae0ba2ec1a/0_0_3620_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Cave\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, all are visions, alternately haunted and comforting. Subtle evolutions in mood and instrumentation come to peaks that are made all the more stunning by their scarcity. There are pianos, but the exhausted trope of the sad piano ballad is nowhere to be found. A luminous, Kraftwerk-like sheen distinguishes the title track itself; on Night Raid, a bell of sorts tolls. At its very climax, the catastrophic moment where a small child abandons his bucket and spade and \u201cclimbs into the sun\u201d, the final track collapses in on itself, a pulsating, flickering black hole of electronic absence that is more astonishing than any cheap pile-on of violins.</p> <p>Cave is still Cave, though. This rollercoaster ride comes bookended by two fables. Spinning Song takes an Elvis-like character and plants a tree in his garden: the launch of a suite of songs with all the force of myth, in which a flotilla of galleons sails into the predawn air and sea creatures are sprung from the deep. In among all this hallucinatory elegance sit everyday vignettes: listening to the radio in the kitchen, sitting in a car park.</p> <p>At the end, Cave reprises the Buddhist tale of <a href=\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisa_Gotami\" title=\"\">Kisa Gotami</a>, a heartbroken mother combing each house in a village for a mustard seed with which to save her child, the Buddha\u2019s proviso being that the seeds had to come from houses where there had not been a death.</p> <p>She can\u2019t find a single one. No one is untouched by loss. And this album finds Cave comforted by the universality of suffering, and the succour of those who gathered around him. \u201cFor we are not alone it seems, so many riders in the sky,\u201d Cave observes on Galleon Ship. On Ghosteen Speaks, the spirit notes: \u201cI think my friends have gathered here for me.\u201d</p>",

You might have thought bereavement might have unleashed a raging, vengeful beast within Cave \u2013 there is a cougar on this album, prowling the perimeter of a California compound, \u201cwith a terrible engine of wrath for a heart\u201d, but it is the sole irruption here of the old, Old Testament Cave. Listening to these 11 songs requires a ready supply of absorbent materials, some rehydration salts \u2013 it is so very sad \u2013 and perhaps a metaphysician on call. Quite apart from the devastation in its recurrent themes \u2013 Jesus in his mother\u2019s arms, blackened butterflies, stairways to heaven, a malevolent, Pied Piper-like sun that steals children away \u2013 Ghosteen is an album about the very nature of what is real and what is not, and who is to judge. Bright Horses, one of the most beautiful songs here, sets loose metaphorical horses of love with \u201cmanes full of fire\u201d into an apocalyptic landscape. But then Cave reins them back in. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all so sick and tired of seeing things as they are,\u201d he aches, \u201cThe horses are just horses and their manes aren\u2019t full of fire, and the fields are just fields and there ain\u2019t no Lord.\u201d Cave, though, feels the continued presence of his son, \u201ca little white shape dancing at the end of the world\u201d. Cave assures us he\u2019s coming home \u201con the 5.30 train\u201d. Why not believe in ghosts? \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with loving something you can\u2019t hold in your hand,\u201d Cave muses, on the title track. And Arthur\u2019s analogue, the Ghosteen, appears from time to time, to say: \u201cI am beside you.\u201d As to where we go when we die, this career-long purveyor of religious imagery doesn\u2019t tackle that directly. \u201cWe are here, and you are where you are,\u201d he puts it movingly, on a song called Fireflies, the first sign of this new album, its lyrics released via the Red Hand Files a year ago. The album\u2019s vivid cover art, meanwhile, is a kitsch paradise by the artist Tom du Bois in which flamingos frolic and lions lie down with lambs, signalling a radical change of emotional landscape for the Bad Seeds. And yet Ghosteen completes a trilogy of records connected by their sound: Push the Sky Away (2013), Skeleton Tree and Ghosteen are all keening, subliminally orchestral works, swirling with electronic mood music; they supersede the rock format and solo piano of previous Bad Seeds or Cave solo works, underscoring the cornerstone presence of violinist Warren Ellis, who also provides revelatory backing vocals. It takes a moment to decipher Cave\u2019s explanation that the songs on Part One are the children, and the songs on Part Two are their parents. These are not two sets of songs sung from generational points of view, but rather, Ghosteen\u2019s second half contains the seeds of its first: the songs of Part One may have been spun off from Part Two. Ultimately, all are visions, alternately haunted and comforting. Subtle evolutions in mood and instrumentation come to peaks that are made all the more stunning by their scarcity. There are pianos, but the exhausted trope of the sad piano ballad is nowhere to be found. A luminous, Kraftwerk-like sheen distinguishes the title track itself; on Night Raid, a bell of sorts tolls. At its very climax, the catastrophic moment where a small child abandons his bucket and spade and \u201cclimbs into the sun\u201d, the final track collapses in on itself, a pulsating, flickering black hole of electronic absence that is more astonishing than any cheap pile-on of violins. Cave is still Cave, though. This rollercoaster ride comes bookended by two fables. Spinning Song takes an Elvis-like character and plants a tree in his garden: the launch of a suite of songs with all the force of myth, in which a flotilla of galleons sails into the predawn air and sea creatures are sprung from the deep. In among all this hallucinatory elegance sit everyday vignettes: listening to the radio in the kitchen, sitting in a car park. At the end, Cave reprises the Buddhist tale of Kisa Gotami, a heartbroken mother combing each house in a village for a mustard seed with which to save her child, the Buddha\u2019s proviso being that the seeds had to come from houses where there had not been a death. She can\u2019t find a single one. No one is untouched by loss. And this album finds Cave comforted by the universality of suffering, and the succour of those who gathered around him. \u201cFor we are not alone it seems, so many riders in the sky,\u201d Cave observes on Galleon Ship. On Ghosteen Speaks, the spirit notes: \u201cI think my friends have gathered here for me.\u201d",

      "body": "<p> William Wegman did not start his art career wanting to photograph dogs. But dogs, it turned out, wanted to be photographed by him. His first great muse, a Weimaraner called Man Ray, noodled around in front of the camera until Wegman decided to click the shutter. That was in 1970. Wegman had grown up in the 1950s obsessed by a droll comedy duo, <a href=\"http://bobandray.com/\" title=\"\">Bob and Ray</a>; suddenly he had a sidekick of his own. He and Man Ray already visited galleries and bars together. Now they started making photos and videos, too, revelling in a kind of spare and poetic slapstick. \u201cHe was a great dog for that,\u201d says Wegman wistfully. \u201cReally serious and so concentrated and funny.\u201d</p> <p>We are in a large sunlit room in Maine, so far north that we are practically in Canada. Wegman has been giving me a grand tour of his lakeside retreat, a converted hotel from 1889 and an Aladdin\u2019s cave of props and costumes that collectively make for an illustrated timeline of his long career. Below us, a lake sparkles silver through the trees. Two dogs \u2013 Flo and Topper \u2013 occupy a sofa, settling into poses that demonstrate the elegant form and posture that makes them such camera-loving subjects. Aged eight and seven, they are the latest in a line of Weimaraners that have fixed Wegman in the public imagination as dog whisperer supreme. As he points out, \u201cThey like to be tall, which is why it\u2019s easy to work with them.\u201d There\u2019s often something a little discombobulating about them, especially when draped in full-length gowns or suits. They have canine features, but human affectations, like mythological creatures that exist in dreams.</p> <p>If his partnership with Man Ray was fortuitous rather than planned back then, it now seems preordained. As a conceptual artist, Wegman had been taking the quotidian and making it strange from the moment he got to art school in the early 60s. What is more quotidian than a dog? What is stranger than a dog made to look like an elephant? Or, a dog teaching children to count, as in his video segments for <em>Sesame Street</em>? For that matter, how many artists appeal as much to children as to adults? Or get to have their work shown in the world\u2019s greatest museums, and also turned into calendars, greetings cards and a series of public mosaics in a New York subway station? Some artists might be sniffy about that. Not Wegman. \u201cI was very fierce about that,\u201d he says. \u201cThese works were not site-specific, they could be seen and disseminated, they could have an audience that wasn\u2019t just limited to the wall of the gallery in New York.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0db83b3d123185a5fe279bd88217bc76ba9b93e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0db83b3d123185a5fe279bd88217bc76ba9b93e8/0_458_4500_4808/936.jpg\" alt=\"A Weimaraner dressed in a bright red track suit top with a thick gold chain around his neck.

(The signs, sadly, almost never deliver on their promise.) Just as it feels you have run out of road, you spot the tennis courts. They are made of red clay with an old-school umpire\u2019s chair at the net. A row of white hydrangeas glows in the sun. On cue, Flo and Topper fly forth, sleek and gorgeous, leaping around the car in full-throated greeting. Wegman\u2019s 24-year-old son, Atlas \u2013 named for the sonogram machine on which his heartbeat was first detected \u2013 bounces down the steps to shout directions on where to park. It could be the set of a Wes Anderson movie.</p> <p>Inside the house, old wooden tennis rackets and vintage snow shoes line a wall. Christine Burgin, a distinguished gallerist and publisher who married Wegman in the early 90s, is making pasta with leeks for dinner. Lola, their 21-year-old daughter, sits near a fireplace reading a Stefan Zweig biography of Balzac. There is no TV, and no one seems to know the wifi code. Mobile phone service was last spotted at least an hour down the road. No problem, books are everywhere.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At art school I became much more of a regular person. I had girlfriends</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wegman first came to the area as a teenager, riding up from his home in Massachusetts for a fishing expedition with friends. \u201cWe hit a rock driving into Kennebego Lake and this guy who owned a lodge towed our car, fixed it and put us up for a week,\u201d he recalls. The guy was Bud Russell, a local hero and coincidentally Kurt Russell\u2019s uncle. Wegman was 14 and had already learned to paint watercolours alongside his mother (she stopped as soon he got better than her), but he didn\u2019t think about art school until a teacher suggested it, which is how he wound up at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston. \u201cI was pretty naive when I went to art school,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then everything was opened up \u2013 religion, art, music.\u201d</p> <p>At art college, he shared a room with two older, devout Catholics. \u201cI would go to church every Sunday and feel like I was levitating,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI suppose if I was born in another era, it would be marijuana or LSD.\u201d For a while he considered converting to Catholicism, but the allure wore off after a few years, in part he says because he saw that girls were crazy for him and why deprive himself? \u201cI just sort of went, \u2018Ta-da! I\u2019m free!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI became much more of a regular person after that\u2026 I had girlfriends.\u201d</p> <p>Since it was the 60s and the Vietnam War was exploding, Wegman wisely secured a deferment and went to the University of Illinois on a grant to study cybernetics. But he hated Illinois: \u201cIt was just cornfields and sort of bleak and no one liked me there.\u201d He had also come to the conclusion, along with most young artists at the time, that painting was pass\u00e9. He thinks his rebellion was exacerbated by his newfound friendships with avant-garde composers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/john-cage\" title=\"\">John Cage</a>, who seemed to be doing far more interesting things. So he went to Wisconsin, as a visiting artist, but burned bridges there, too. \u201cI liked to take ordinary things, like the library, and rearrange it to be out of sync,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI liked taking order and shifting it.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c1460b022814284f7b71459962b8a8a9499eb6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c1460b022814284f7b71459962b8a8a9499eb6c/0_1430_4320_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of a hand, splayed out, on one of the Weimaraner's fur\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They have canine features, but human affectations, like mythological creatures.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benedict Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Wegman moved to California in 1970 he was beginning to find his artistic voice, working with photography and video, often putting himself in front of the camera. Although dependent on food stamps and generous benefactors (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ed-ruscha\" title=\"\">Ed Ruscha </a>bought 50 of his works for $50 a pop) he was creating a body of work that was disciplined and tight. But still inverting ordinary things to make them strange.</p> <p>Wegman\u2019s early work was popular in the UK, but things changed after Man Ray. \u201cI think England had a problem with my later work, with the dogs, especially the dressed-up stuff,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cParis has always loved my dressed-up dog things.\u201d His own enthusiasm for London is undimmed. \u201cI was friends with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gilbertandgeorge\" title=\"\">Gilbert &amp; George</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were hilarious. My wife at the time, Gayle, did all kinds of crazy stuff with them.\u201d What kind of crazy stuff? \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it\u2019s sort of dark things.\u201d What would that involve? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Use your imagination\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It was only when Wegman began using the giant 20x24 Polaroid camera in 1979 that he noticed Man Ray was losing his figure. The new photos were rich in detail and exposed things that remained hidden in black and white. \u201cI started covering him up,\u201d he confesses. \u201cIt became really apparent he was an old dog.\u201d By that point Man Ray was an international art star, feted on talk shows and immortalised in videos for <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. Wegman found it almost impossible to imagine a future beyond him. When his friend the actor John Belushi asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do when your dog dies?\u201d it hit a raw nerve. \u201cHe sort of got an evil look in his eye,\u201d Wegman recalls. \u201cHe knew it would be dark and thought I\u2019d just be finished.\u201d</p> <p>Wegman, it turned out, was not finished<em><strong> </strong></em>\u2013 not by a long shot. It took a few years before another Weimaraner \u2013 Fay Ray \u2013 stole into his heart, and art.

      "bodyText": "William Wegman did not start his art career wanting to photograph dogs. But dogs, it turned out, wanted to be photographed by him. His first great muse, a Weimaraner called Man Ray, noodled around in front of the camera until Wegman decided to click the shutter. That was in 1970. Wegman had grown up in the 1950s obsessed by a droll comedy duo, Bob and Ray; suddenly he had a sidekick of his own. He and Man Ray already visited galleries and bars together. Now they started making photos and videos, too, revelling in a kind of spare and poetic slapstick. \u201cHe was a great dog for that,\u201d says Wegman wistfully. \u201cReally serious and so concentrated and funny.\u201d We are in a large sunlit room in Maine, so far north that we are practically in Canada. Wegman has been giving me a grand tour of his lakeside retreat, a converted hotel from 1889 and an Aladdin\u2019s cave of props and costumes that collectively make for an illustrated timeline of his long career. Below us, a lake sparkles silver through the trees. Two dogs \u2013 Flo and Topper \u2013 occupy a sofa, settling into poses that demonstrate the elegant form and posture that makes them such camera-loving subjects. Aged eight and seven, they are the latest in a line of Weimaraners that have fixed Wegman in the public imagination as dog whisperer supreme. As he points out, \u201cThey like to be tall, which is why it\u2019s easy to work with them.\u201d There\u2019s often something a little discombobulating about them, especially when draped in full-length gowns or suits. They have canine features, but human affectations, like mythological creatures that exist in dreams. If his partnership with Man Ray was fortuitous rather than planned back then, it now seems preordained. As a conceptual artist, Wegman had been taking the quotidian and making it strange from the moment he got to art school in the early 60s. What is more quotidian than a dog? What is stranger than a dog made to look like an elephant? Or, a dog teaching children to count, as in his video segments for Sesame Street? For that matter, how many artists appeal as much to children as to adults? Or get to have their work shown in the world\u2019s greatest museums, and also turned into calendars, greetings cards and a series of public mosaics in a New York subway station? Some artists might be sniffy about that. Not Wegman. \u201cI was very fierce about that,\u201d he says. \u201cThese works were not site-specific, they could be seen and disseminated, they could have an audience that wasn\u2019t just limited to the wall of the gallery in New York.\u201d Three major shows this year serve as a testament to Wegman\u2019s restless and endlessly inventive career: the wide-ranging career survey Outside In at the Shelbourne Museum in Vermont; Being Human at Masi Lugano in Switzerland, which is on until 6 January 2020; and a stall at the Frieze Masters in London, which focuses on his early conceptual pieces, and closes today. To get to Wegman\u2019s lakeside retreat from New York is an eight-hour drive through Connecticut and Vermont, and across New Hampshire, onwards and upwards until you feel there is nothing between you and the edge of the world but trees and sky \u2013 and those exotic road signs warning of moose crossing. (The signs, sadly, almost never deliver on their promise.) Just as it feels you have run out of road, you spot the tennis courts. They are made of red clay with an old-school umpire\u2019s chair at the net. A row of white hydrangeas glows in the sun. On cue, Flo and Topper fly forth, sleek and gorgeous, leaping around the car in full-throated greeting. Wegman\u2019s 24-year-old son, Atlas \u2013 named for the sonogram machine on which his heartbeat was first detected \u2013 bounces down the steps to shout directions on where to park. It could be the set of a Wes Anderson movie. Inside the house, old wooden tennis rackets and vintage snow shoes line a wall. Christine Burgin, a distinguished gallerist and publisher who married Wegman in the early 90s, is making pasta with leeks for dinner. Lola, their 21-year-old daughter, sits near a fireplace reading a Stefan Zweig biography of Balzac. There is no TV, and no one seems to know the wifi code. Mobile phone service was last spotted at least an hour down the road. No problem, books are everywhere. Wegman first came to the area as a teenager, riding up from his home in Massachusetts for a fishing expedition with friends. \u201cWe hit a rock driving into Kennebego Lake and this guy who owned a lodge towed our car, fixed it and put us up for a week,\u201d he recalls. The guy was Bud Russell, a local hero and coincidentally Kurt Russell\u2019s uncle. Wegman was 14 and had already learned to paint watercolours alongside his mother (she stopped as soon he got better than her), but he didn\u2019t think about art school until a teacher suggested it, which is how he wound up at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston. \u201cI was pretty naive when I went to art school,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then everything was opened up \u2013 religion, art, music.\u201d At art college, he shared a room with two older, devout Catholics. \u201cI would go to church every Sunday and feel like I was levitating,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI suppose if I was born in another era, it would be marijuana or LSD.\u201d For a while he considered converting to Catholicism, but the allure wore off after a few years, in part he says because he saw that girls were crazy for him and why deprive himself? \u201cI just sort of went, \u2018Ta-da! I\u2019m free!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI became much more of a regular person after that\u2026 I had girlfriends.\u201d Since it was the 60s and the Vietnam War was exploding, Wegman wisely secured a deferment and went to the University of Illinois on a grant to study cybernetics. But he hated Illinois: \u201cIt was just cornfields and sort of bleak and no one liked me there.\u201d He had also come to the conclusion, along with most young artists at the time, that painting was pass\u00e9. He thinks his rebellion was exacerbated by his newfound friendships with avant-garde composers such as John Cage, who seemed to be doing far more interesting things. So he went to Wisconsin, as a visiting artist, but burned bridges there, too. \u201cI liked to take ordinary things, like the library, and rearrange it to be out of sync,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI liked taking order and shifting it.\u201d When Wegman moved to California in 1970 he was beginning to find his artistic voice, working with photography and video, often putting himself in front of the camera. Although dependent on food stamps and generous benefactors (Ed Ruscha bought 50 of his works for $50 a pop) he was creating a body of work that was disciplined and tight. But still inverting ordinary things to make them strange. Wegman\u2019s early work was popular in the UK, but things changed after Man Ray. \u201cI think England had a problem with my later work, with the dogs, especially the dressed-up stuff,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cParis has always loved my dressed-up dog things.\u201d His own enthusiasm for London is undimmed. \u201cI was friends with Gilbert &amp; George,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were hilarious. My wife at the time, Gayle, did all kinds of crazy stuff with them.\u201d What kind of crazy stuff? \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it\u2019s sort of dark things.\u201d What would that involve? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Use your imagination\u2026\u201d It was only when Wegman began using the giant 20x24 Polaroid camera in 1979 that he noticed Man Ray was losing his figure. The new photos were rich in detail and exposed things that remained hidden in black and white. \u201cI started covering him up,\u201d he confesses. \u201cIt became really apparent he was an old dog.\u201d By that point Man Ray was an international art star, feted on talk shows and immortalised in videos for Saturday Night Live. Wegman found it almost impossible to imagine a future beyond him. When his friend the actor John Belushi asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do when your dog dies?\u201d it hit a raw nerve. \u201cHe sort of got an evil look in his eye,\u201d Wegman recalls. \u201cHe knew it would be dark and thought I\u2019d just be finished.\u201d Wegman, it turned out, was not finished \u2013 not by a long shot. It took a few years before another Weimaraner \u2013 Fay Ray \u2013 stole into his heart, and art. She was the Bacall to Man Ray\u2019s Bogie \u2013 and looked terrific in a gown. \u201cFay always played more stern characters, she looked darker,\u201d says Wegman. He gestures towards Flo on the sofa. \u201cThis dog reminds me of Fay a lot \u2013 serious, tries hard, wants to make sure she\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d He thinks Weimaraners have a neutral quality that enables them to better inhabit characters. \u201cIf they were Dalmatians or Labradors, it would be, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a Lab dressed up!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut Weimaraners are more spooky and shadowy.\u201d Wegman knows anthropomorphising animals is not for everyone. \u201cThe only thing that makes me angry is when people say the dogs are being abused,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re just so enlarged by the work.\u201d He recalls 1978, the year he avoided shooting Man Ray. \u201cIt was really miserable for him, I could tell,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019d come into my studio and just slump down on the floor, like, \u2018You\u2019re not going to do anything?\u2019\u201d It was a miserable time for Wegman, too.

In 1980, he quit alcohol for good. The cameras have changed over the years \u2013 the Polaroid was retired in 2007 \u2013 and so have the dogs, though all of them are descended from Fay. After Man Ray\u2019s death, Wegman decided there should always be an overlap between generations to mitigate heartbreak. But he is 75 now, and knows a time will come \u2013 must come \u2013 when his dogs will outlive him. \u201cI think after these two, it\u2019s going to be a little strange,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that another dog could last until I\u2019m 90 now.\u201d He remembers how his father struggled to walk in his 90s. \u201cI\u2019d have to leave it to Christine, but she\u2019s not so much a dog person,\u201d he says.

Police? I\u2019d like to report a murder</h2> <p>It\u2019s not often a 6,700-word piece of literary criticism goes viral. This week, however, everyone has been rightly raving about Patricia Lockwood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n19/patricia-lockwood/malfunctioning-sex-robot\">elegant evisceration of John Updike in the London Review of Books</a>. \u201cI was hired as an assassin,\u201d Lockwood begins. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring in a 37-year-old woman to review John Updike in the year of our Lord 2019 unless you\u2019re hoping to see blood on the ceiling.\u201d A lot of blood proceeds to hit the ceiling. \u201cNo one can seem to agree on [Updike\u2019s] surviving merits,\u201d Lockwood notes. \u201cHe wrote like an angel, the consensus goes, except when he was writing like a malfunctioning sex robot attempting to administer cunnilingus to his typewriter.\u201d</p> <h2>Supreme court hears first major abortion case since Kavanaugh confirmed</h2> <p>On Friday, the US supreme court announced it will be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/04/763863712/supreme-court-revisits-abortion-with-louisiana-case\">reviewing a Louisiana regulation</a> that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital 30 miles away. This requirement severely restricts access to abortion, particularly for low-income women. The supreme court struck down a similar Texas law in 2016. Justice Anthony Kennedy cast the decisive vote in that case; he has now been replaced by Brett Kavanaugh.

Maybe I should call on a man.\u201d Dr. E David Davis later explained this was \u201ca joke\u201d. He has now been suspended, so I guess the joke\u2019s on him.</p> <h2>Over 30% of Japanese women with mental health issues blame workplace harassment</h2> <p>According to a government survey released on Tuesday, 36% of Japanese women with mental illnesses said it was caused by some form of harassment at work. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/health/japan-overwork-survey-intl-hnk/index.html\">As CNN reports</a>, \u201cJapan remains a male-dominated society and \u2026 is ranked 110 out of 149 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) latest global <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2018.pdf\">gender gap index</a>.\u201d</p> <h2>Praise be, we finally know what The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is about</h2> <p>A Canadian couple recently made the somewhat bizarre choice of incorporating a Handmaid\u2019s Tale-themed wedding photo into their nuptials.

Dealt with two early high kicks comfortably, made a fine tackle on Carreras in the corner and took his try well. <strong>8/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>14 Anthony Watson </strong>Not necessarily his fault but did not see the ball nearly as often as he would have liked. On the rare occasion he was given space he looked bright. <strong>6/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>13 Manu Tuilagi </strong>Fortunate to escape further sanction for taking Boffelli a moment early in the air and one poor knock-on. All in all not at his most conspicuous. <strong>5/10</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/05/england-argentina-rugby-world-cup-2019-pool-c-match-report\">England dismiss feisty Argentina after Tom\u00e1s Lavanini sees red</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>12 Owen Farrell (capt) </strong>Again the recipient of a high tackle that led to a red card and four consecutive missed kicks is practically unheard of. Gathered himself after the interval. <strong>6/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>11 Jonny May </strong>Could not really fail to score his first try of the tournament and showed how well rounded his game is now. Once or twice ran backwards, though. <strong>7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>10 George Ford </strong>Argentina\u2019s big runners sought him out at every occasion so he will have enjoyed bursting through two defenders for his try. Another superb performance. Man of the match. <strong>8/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>9 Ben Youngs </strong>Still not quite happening for him \u2013 perhaps he\u2019s trying to force things too much \u2013 but he took his try well on his 92nd appearance and remains a key senior figure. <strong>6/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>1 Joe Marler </strong>Among England\u2019s most fearsome tacklers. Gave away one silly penalty but he does not want to lose his place to Mako Vunipola and he is doing all he can to keep it. <strong>7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>2 Jamie George </strong>There is an argument to say he is fast becoming the player England could least live without. Solid rather than spectacular here but he is so reliable. <strong>7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>3 Kyle Sinckler </strong>Conceded an early penalty but made up for it by winning one at key scrum. The kind of player it must be a nightmare to play against when down to 14. <strong>7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>4 Maro Itoje </strong>Imposed himself on opponents as the match wore on. Only his fifth international appearance all year and he is evidently hungry for four more. <strong>7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>5 George Kruis </strong>England\u2019s lineout was not flawless but it is easy to see why Eddie Jones turns to him for the harder matches. A quiet time in the loose, though. <strong>6/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>6 Tom Curry </strong>Natural tendency is to involve himself as much as possible but as he grows into blindside role he is learning to pick and choose his moments. <strong>7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>7 Sam Underhill </strong>Two thunderous hits early in the second half typified his effort as England turned the screw. He ended as England\u2019s top tackler and with tank emptied. <strong>8/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>8 Billy Vunipola </strong>Half-time departure with left foot heavily strapped is a concern. Apart from one powerful run he was not having his best game and coughed up two turnovers. <strong>6/10</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"796b7391379e62ac1c4e015e6dc0bc980bc02ada\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/796b7391379e62ac1c4e015e6dc0bc980bc02ada/0_87_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elliot Daly scores for England against Argentina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elliot Daly scores for England against Argentina.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Replacements: Lewis Ludlam</strong> (for B Vunipola, ht) Continues to impress <strong>7</strong>; <strong>Willi Heinz</strong> (for Youngs, 48) Solid <strong>6</strong>; Courtney Lawes (for Kruis 55) One penalty against for late tackle <strong>5</strong>; <strong>Mako Vunipola</strong> (for Marler, 63) Looking lean after so long out but gave away scrum penalty <strong>6</strong>; Dan Cole (for Sinckler 63) <strong>n/a</strong>; <strong>Luke Cowan-Dickie</strong> (for George, 65) Yet another try from a driving lineout <strong>7</strong>; <strong>Jack Nowell</strong> (for Watson, 69) Typical tenacity for try <strong>7</strong>; Henry Slade (for Ford, 69) <strong>n/a</strong></p> \n<h2>Argentina</h2> \n<p>Emiliano Boffelli <strong>5</strong>; Mat\u00edas Moroni <strong>6</strong>, Matias Orlando <strong>5</strong>, Jeronimo De La Fuente <strong>5</strong>, Santiago Carreras <strong>5</strong>; Benjamin Urdapilleta <strong>6</strong>, Tomas Cubelli <strong>5</strong>; Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro <strong>6</strong>, Julian Montoya <strong>6</strong>, Juan Figallo <strong>6</strong>, Guido Petti Pagadizabal <strong>5</strong>, Tomas Lavanini <strong>2</strong>, Pablo Matera <strong>6</strong>, Marcos Kremer <strong>7</strong>, Javier Ortega Desio <strong>6</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Replacements: Bautista Delguy</strong> (for Orlando, 56) <strong>6</strong>; <strong>Lucas Mensa</strong> (for Urdapilleta, 61) <strong>5</strong>; <strong>Felipe Ezcurra</strong> (for Cubelli, 58) <strong>5</strong>; <strong>Mayco Vivas</strong> (for Chaparro, 49) <strong>6</strong>; <strong>Agustin Creevy</strong> (for Montoya, 49) <strong>6</strong>; <strong>Santiago Medrano</strong> (for Figallo, 49) <strong>6</strong>; <strong>Tomas Lezana</strong> (for Petti, 54) <strong>5</strong>; <strong>Matias Alemanno</strong> (for Desio, 49) <strong>5</strong></p>",

On the rare occasion he was given space he looked bright. 6/10 13 Manu Tuilagi Fortunate to escape further sanction for taking Boffelli a moment early in the air and one poor knock-on. All in all not at his most conspicuous. 5/10 12 Owen Farrell (capt) Again the recipient of a high tackle that led to a red card and four consecutive missed kicks is practically unheard of. Gathered himself after the interval. 6/10 11 Jonny May Could not really fail to score his first try of the tournament and showed how well rounded his game is now. Once or twice ran backwards, though. 7/10 10 George Ford Argentina\u2019s big runners sought him out at every occasion so he will have enjoyed bursting through two defenders for his try. Another superb performance. Man of the match. 8/10 9 Ben Youngs Still not quite happening for him \u2013 perhaps he\u2019s trying to force things too much \u2013 but he took his try well on his 92nd appearance and remains a key senior figure. 6/10 1 Joe Marler Among England\u2019s most fearsome tacklers. Gave away one silly penalty but he does not want to lose his place to Mako Vunipola and he is doing all he can to keep it. 7/10 2 Jamie George There is an argument to say he is fast becoming the player England could least live without. Solid rather than spectacular here but he is so reliable. 7/10 3 Kyle Sinckler Conceded an early penalty but made up for it by winning one at key scrum. The kind of player it must be a nightmare to play against when down to 14. 7/10 4 Maro Itoje Imposed himself on opponents as the match wore on. Only his fifth international appearance all year and he is evidently hungry for four more. 7/10 5 George Kruis England\u2019s lineout was not flawless but it is easy to see why Eddie Jones turns to him for the harder matches. A quiet time in the loose, though. 6/10 6 Tom Curry Natural tendency is to involve himself as much as possible but as he grows into blindside role he is learning to pick and choose his moments. 7/10 7 Sam Underhill Two thunderous hits early in the second half typified his effort as England turned the screw. He ended as England\u2019s top tackler and with tank emptied. 8/10 8 Billy Vunipola Half-time departure with left foot heavily strapped is a concern. Apart from one powerful run he was not having his best game and coughed up two turnovers. 6/10 Replacements: Lewis Ludlam (for B Vunipola, ht) Continues to impress 7; Willi Heinz (for Youngs, 48) Solid 6; Courtney Lawes (for Kruis 55) One penalty against for late tackle 5; Mako Vunipola (for Marler, 63) Looking lean after so long out but gave away scrum penalty 6; Dan Cole (for Sinckler 63) n/a; Luke Cowan-Dickie (for George, 65) Yet another try from a driving lineout 7; Jack Nowell (for Watson, 69) Typical tenacity for try 7; Henry Slade (for Ford, 69) n/a Argentina Emiliano Boffelli 5; Mat\u00edas Moroni 6, Matias Orlando 5, Jeronimo De La Fuente 5, Santiago Carreras 5; Benjamin Urdapilleta 6, Tomas Cubelli 5; Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro 6, Julian Montoya 6, Juan Figallo 6, Guido Petti Pagadizabal 5, Tomas Lavanini 2, Pablo Matera 6, Marcos Kremer 7, Javier Ortega Desio 6 Replacements: Bautista Delguy (for Orlando, 56) 6; Lucas Mensa (for Urdapilleta, 61) 5; Felipe Ezcurra (for Cubelli, 58) 5; Mayco Vivas (for Chaparro, 49) 6; Agustin Creevy (for Montoya, 49) 6; Santiago Medrano (for Figallo, 49) 6; Tomas Lezana (for Petti, 54) 5; Matias Alemanno (for Desio, 49) 5",

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard has drawn up a new policy to ensure officers continue the deeply controversial practice of sharing data on victims of crime \u2013 including domestic and sexual violence offences \u2013 with the immigration authorities. After a previous legal challenge from campaigners to stop the \u201cunlawful practice\u201d the Met ditched the policy earlier this year. Yet it has emerged that the force has redrafted the controversial measure, issuing new guidance which is almost identical to the previous policy it withdrew. The move is now the subject of fresh legal action by Southall Black Sisters and a domestic abuse victim represented by the human rights group Liberty, in an attempt to prevent police passing on information about people suspected of being in the country illegally to deportation authorities if they come forward as victims or witnesses of crime. Their case argues that handing over such people to the Home Office for immigration enforcement undermines the fight against crime and erodes public safety. It also means individuals may remain in situations where they are repeatedly abused or forced to participate in crime. One victim of violent and sexual domestic abuse, who is among those bringing the legal challenge against the Met, said that her husband had threatened to kill her, but that she had never reported him to police for fear that officers would report her to the Home Office. She was afraid that she risked being detained and potentially deported to her country of origin, where she faced persecution because her marriage had failed. Aisha, not her real name, entered the UK legally and has worked for many years, but partly as a result of her husband\u2019s abuse is currently deemed an \u201coverstay\u201d. She said she was \u201creally frightened\u201d about what might happen to her. \u201cI worry that he is now so angry that he might just kill me as he has threatened to do.

It was launched three days later on 14 August. The Met\u2019s new policy states: \u201cWhere police are investigating a crime, and during that investigation, whether on the initial report or subsequently, it becomes apparent that the victim/witness is also suspected of being an illegal immigrant, it is wholly appropriate that the officer in the case should contact immigration enforcement.\u201d Debaleena Dasgupta, Liberty lawyer, said: \u201cThe Met is failing to protect victims of crime. Unless a data-sharing policy ensures all victims can seek police protection and report crimes without fear of immigration enforcement, it risks being unlawful. \u201cShe added: We hope the Met will withdraw this policy and replace it with one that allows victims to access their protection and seek justice.\u201d Liberty has written to Met lawyers saying the \u201cupdated policy remains unlawful on exactly the same grounds as the previous one\u201d. Court documents from the human rights group to the Met state: \u201cThe policy sends a clear indication to investigating police officers that they should inform HOIE [Home Office Immigration Enforcement] of a suspicion that a victim is an illegal immigrant, in other words that passing this information on is mandatory.\u201d Pragna Patel, director of Southall Black Sisters, said she had worked with \u201ccountless\u201d women who \u201care frightened to exit from abuse and seek police protection because they fear being reported to the Home Office\u201d.

It is being investigated by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, and the College of Policing, and could lead to recommendations including that police forces change their policies or working practices. Dasgupta added: \u201cIn the longer term the government must implement permanent separation between all essential frontline services and immigration enforcement so everyone can access support free from fear.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Writers are sometimes described as being so good that one would gladly read their shopping list. Livia Franchini is kind enough to provide the list.</p> <p>In the opening pages of her debut, <em>Shelf Life</em>, we meet Ruth Beadle, a 30-year-old care home nurse, whose fiance Neil has unexpectedly left her after 10 years together. His sudden absence \u2013 the empty indentation of his body in their bed, the gaps in the wardrobe, the missing laundry basket that, for some reason, he took even though he left his dressing gown behind \u2013 leaves her clutching at physical things. It is one of these objects, the shopping list for the forthcoming week, that anchors the novel. Each item on the list becomes a chapter; each chapter provides a window into Ruth\u2019s life, from before Neil and after Neil. I know women like Ruth, have made tea or poured wine for them after their break-ups. But Ruth doesn\u2019t have anyone to pour her wine or make her tea, and over the course of the novel we get an idea of why that is \u2013 why a woman who spends all her time and energy taking care of the people around her doesn\u2019t have anyone she trusts to take care of her.</p> <p>As a structural conceit, the list could easily have been restrictive, but Franchini uses it lightly. Each item permits a jump in time, perspective, even form. \u201cSugar\u201d takes us 10 years into the past, as Neil watches Ruth from the window of the travel agency where he works, keeping obsessive notes on her comings and goings, waiting for the chance to meet \u201chis girl\u201d. \u201cPizza\u201d gives us the diary of Alanna, Ruth\u2019s college roommate, written during a two-week trip she and Ruth took to Italy, a holiday Neil arranged for them and which he used to get near to Ruth. \u201cHoney\u201d is made up of the text messages between Ruth and Neil after the trip, before they were a couple, in which he tells her how badly he wants to get to know her. \u201cDates\u201d comprises the emails Neil sends anonymously to the young woman over whom he has begun to obsess a few months before leaving Ruth. The list draws together the pieces of the novel, adding depth to the narrative and providing a sense of both tidiness and pace.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We get an idea of why a woman who spends her time caring for people doesn\u2019t have anyone she trusts to take care of her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All this makes Neil sound less suited to a relationship than a restraining order. But even more unsettling than his behaviour is the fact that none of the characters in the novel appears to perceive it as particularly troubling, least of all Neil himself. In his interactions with women he consistently stays just the right side of acceptability, and when he crosses the line he does so with plausible deniability. This is what makes Franchini\u2019s characterisation so brilliant \u2013 we all by now recognise the open misogynist, the overt abuser, but the subtle attack, the blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it quality of predatory wokeness: that\u2019s slipperier. It\u2019s clear that Neil thinks he\u2019s done nothing wrong, and if you didn\u2019t consider his actions as a whole, you could almost believe him.</p> <p>The opening scene, in which Ruth washes dishes while Neil tells her about all the love he has inside him and how it doesn\u2019t make sense not to share it with more than one person, made me expect the novel to explore the psyches of two people who weren\u2019t right for each other. But as the evidence piles up, the text messages and emails and remembered conversations, Neil\u2019s behaviour becomes harder for a reader to rationalise, even as his utter self-righteousness, his conviction that the way he moves through the world is beyond reproach, becomes clearer. This kind of entitlement shapes the world, and it is perfectly captured.</p> <p>Franchini is a poet and a translator, and this can be seen in the attention she pays to the flavour, shape and weight of words. For every moment that I wondered how the plot would be resolved, there were several in which I paused, unwilling to move on from an arresting turn of phrase. Some of these are brief and descriptive: clean laundry \u201cpushes its face against the glass of the washing machine\u201d; Ruth and Neil sleep \u201cpressed against one another like flowers in a book\u201d. Elsewhere the lyricism expands on more abstract ideas: \u201cHistory happened in the back rooms while we delayed our knitting: making and unmaking, the stuff of witches.\u201d</p> <p>Altogether, this is a book that should not be missed: a beautifully executed contribution to the discussion of toxic masculine behaviour and the patterns of socialisation that enable it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/06/the-lauras-sara-taylor-review\" title=\"\"><em>\u2022 Sara Taylor\u2019s The Lauras</em></a><em> is published by Windmill.

      "body": "<p>When I was 22, I tried to write a story about a breakup. I\u2019d just been broken-up with. And yes, I was embarrassed to be writing about it. But my heart ached, and I wanted to believe that its ache could yield something profound.</p> <p>Writing about heartbreak came easily, but I struggled with the part of the story about the love itself: the happiness before the fall. When I asked my writing teacher if he could recommend any literary texts that evoked the bliss of love, he suggested Scott Spencer\u2019s novel <em>Endless Love</em>. There I found \u2013 instead of bliss \u2013 a house on fire. Literally: post breakup, a boy has set his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house on fire.</p> <p>My teacher was right, as it turned out: the novel did include ecstatic depictions of early courtship and its glorious surrender, but it seemed telling that even the quest for an account of love\u2019s joy would inevitably lead me to an account of its painful aftermath. Perhaps any story of love is always a story about its ending, or at least a story shadowed and electrified by the possibility of that ending. Breakups summon and sustain narrative more readily than long-lasting love for plenty of obvious reasons; rupture is narrative, after all. Narrative finds no traction without trouble. One could rephrase Tolstoy\u2019s favorite maxim to say \u2013 \u201dHappy relationships are all alike; every unhappy relationship is unhappy in its own way\u201d \u2013 and it would be truthful and limited in the same ways: happiness can be as distinctly textured as its opposite, and broken love affairs can hew pretty closely to some familiar formulas: the affair on business trips, The simmering estrangement over silent dinners, the sleepless siege of having small children, the self-transformation that leaves the other partner behind.</p> <p>But there is something singularly urgent about the appeal of a breakup story: it becomes an attempt to transcribe intimacy in the midst of disappearance, like taking a photograph of a wave before it rushes back to sea. It\u2019s an archiving impulse born of the desire to preserve something that would otherwise be lost. \u201cWhy is it better to last than to burn?\u201d Roland Barthes asks in <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-lover-s-discourse-9780099437420.html\" title=\"\">A Lover\u2019s Discourse</a></em>, and creating art about (or even from) the charred corpse of love is a way to grant the burning its own lasting, its own eloquent immortality.</p> <p>My personal breakup canon includes classics such as Leo Tolstoy\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/02/anna-karenina-tolstoy-five-writers\" title=\"\">Anna Karenina</a></em>, Graham Greene\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/26/100-best-novels-the-end-of-the-affair-graham-greene-observer-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">The End of the Affair</a></em>, Jean Rhys\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/feb/11/2\" title=\"\">Voyage in the Dark</a></em> (though really any of her novels could count) and certainly <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/15/book-beach-wide-sargasso-sea-jean-rhys\" title=\"\">Wide Sargasso Sea</a> </em>\u2013 which is perhaps less a breakup narrative than the story of a woman so forcibly imprisoned in her heartbreak that she will burn the whole house down (a theme emerges) to articulate her rage and demand her freedom. In Alice Munro\u2019s short story \u201cSimon\u2019s Luck\u201d, a woman who gets stood up by a man after several weeks of dating starts checking obituaries for his name \u2013 unable to believe he has fallen out of infatuation so quickly \u2013 and her thought process captures something both absurd and true about the depths of indignation and histrionic grief that even a casual separation can inspire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ab260b069ecf946abb93d26b399e249a1a6a082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ab260b069ecf946abb93d26b399e249a1a6a082/744_319_2760_1656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keira Knightley in Anna Karenina, the 2012 film based on Tolstoy\u2019s novel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keira Knightley in Anna Karenina, the 2012 film based on Tolstoy\u2019s novel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richard Yates\u2019s 1961 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview26\" title=\"\">Revolutionary Road</a></em> charts the disintegrating marriage of Frank and April Wheeler, who live in a soul-crushing Connecticut suburb while they dream of moving to Paris. Though the novel is grim in its vision of suburban conformity and marital estrangement, it excavates from the widening distance between two people a set of aching, nuanced truths about the distances between all of us. James Salter\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/james-salter-forgotten-hero-literature-interview\" title=\"\">Light Years</a></em> (1975) presents a time-lapse portrait of a marriage and its dissolution over the course of 20 years, following Nedra and Viri through pleasure and estrangement. The novel explores the fundamental opacity of other people, describing the consciousness of another person as \u201cmysterious, it is like a forest\u201d \u2013 something you can comprehend from a distance, but that splinters up-close into bewildering light and shadow. It\u2019s a painful novel, but has beautiful moments: apples and wood-handled knives on a picnic, fretted by sun-dappled shade. It\u2019s an image of pleasure from before the marriage sours, insisting that this happiness remains a truth embedded in the story, even if it ultimately gives way to loss. In life, we tell the stories of our breakups not only because these stories hurt, but because we want to say: \u201cThis love was. Some part of it remains.\u201d</p> <p>The urge to think or talk or write about broken relationships is constantly shadowed by shame: the shame of dwelling, the shame of lingering, the shame of solipsism \u2013 the fear that it is somehow weak or useless to spend too much time in the past, that it narrows or forecloses the world. In Edna St Vincent Millay\u2019s poem \u201c<a href=\"https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/only-until-this-cigarette-is-ended/\" title=\"\">Only Until This Cigarette Is Ended</a>\u201d, the speaker grants herself a single cigarette-length span of nostalgia \u2013 \u201cI will permit my memory to recall / The vision of you\u201d \u2013 as if she needs to ration her access to some guilty pleasure. In her poem \u201c<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48636/the-glass-essay\" title=\"\">The Glass Essay</a>\u201d, Anne Carson finds language not just for the devastation of heartbreak but for the shame of being too devastated by it. It\u2019s a poem anchored by the end of a five-year relationship: \u201cNot enough spin on it, / he said of our five years of love. / Inside my chest I felt my heart snap into two pieces / which floated apart \u2026 \u201d In the aftermath, the speaker\u2019s mother becomes a mouthpiece for the idea that one can dwell too long: \u201cYou remember too much, / my mother said to me recently. / Why hold onto that? And I said, / Where can I put it down?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In literature, can we take meaning from what hurts? And when does that attempt become self-serving delusion?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Literary accounts of broken relationships not only try to \u201chold onto that\u201d by transcribing or inventing stories of lost or soured love, they also try to answer the question of why it\u2019s worth holding on in the first place. It\u2019s one of the great reckonings at the heart of literature itself: can we extract meaning from what hurts? And when does that attempt verge into self-serving delusion or come up against its own limits? Randall Jarrell famously outlined the sceptical take in his poem \u201c<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57410/90-north\" title=\"\">90 North</a>\u201d: \u201cPain comes from the darkness / And we call it wisdom. It is pain.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, we keep seeking that wisdom. In his poem \u201cEurydice\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/09/ocean-vuong-on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-interview\" title=\"\">Ocean Vuong</a> describes this painful illumination as \u201cgravity breaking / our kneecaps just to show us the sky\u201d. Nowhere do we seek the sky as pointedly or hopelessly as we do in stories of lost love. In \u201cThe Glass Essay\u201d, Carson doesn\u2019t dramatise the process of recovering from heartbreak so much as she documents the anguished mess of making meaning from it \u2013 or rather, struggling with the proposition that it holds any meaning at all.

      "bodyText": "When I was 22, I tried to write a story about a breakup. I\u2019d just been broken-up with. And yes, I was embarrassed to be writing about it. But my heart ached, and I wanted to believe that its ache could yield something profound. Writing about heartbreak came easily, but I struggled with the part of the story about the love itself: the happiness before the fall. When I asked my writing teacher if he could recommend any literary texts that evoked the bliss of love, he suggested Scott Spencer\u2019s novel Endless Love. There I found \u2013 instead of bliss \u2013 a house on fire. Literally: post breakup, a boy has set his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house on fire. My teacher was right, as it turned out: the novel did include ecstatic depictions of early courtship and its glorious surrender, but it seemed telling that even the quest for an account of love\u2019s joy would inevitably lead me to an account of its painful aftermath. Perhaps any story of love is always a story about its ending, or at least a story shadowed and electrified by the possibility of that ending. Breakups summon and sustain narrative more readily than long-lasting love for plenty of obvious reasons; rupture is narrative, after all. Narrative finds no traction without trouble. One could rephrase Tolstoy\u2019s favorite maxim to say \u2013 \u201dHappy relationships are all alike; every unhappy relationship is unhappy in its own way\u201d \u2013 and it would be truthful and limited in the same ways: happiness can be as distinctly textured as its opposite, and broken love affairs can hew pretty closely to some familiar formulas: the affair on business trips, The simmering estrangement over silent dinners, the sleepless siege of having small children, the self-transformation that leaves the other partner behind. But there is something singularly urgent about the appeal of a breakup story: it becomes an attempt to transcribe intimacy in the midst of disappearance, like taking a photograph of a wave before it rushes back to sea. It\u2019s an archiving impulse born of the desire to preserve something that would otherwise be lost. \u201cWhy is it better to last than to burn?\u201d Roland Barthes asks in A Lover\u2019s Discourse, and creating art about (or even from) the charred corpse of love is a way to grant the burning its own lasting, its own eloquent immortality. My personal breakup canon includes classics such as Leo Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina, Graham Greene\u2019s The End of the Affair, Jean Rhys\u2019s Voyage in the Dark (though really any of her novels could count) and certainly Wide Sargasso Sea \u2013 which is perhaps less a breakup narrative than the story of a woman so forcibly imprisoned in her heartbreak that she will burn the whole house down (a theme emerges) to articulate her rage and demand her freedom. In Alice Munro\u2019s short story \u201cSimon\u2019s Luck\u201d, a woman who gets stood up by a man after several weeks of dating starts checking obituaries for his name \u2013 unable to believe he has fallen out of infatuation so quickly \u2013 and her thought process captures something both absurd and true about the depths of indignation and histrionic grief that even a casual separation can inspire. Richard Yates\u2019s 1961 novel Revolutionary Road charts the disintegrating marriage of Frank and April Wheeler, who live in a soul-crushing Connecticut suburb while they dream of moving to Paris. Though the novel is grim in its vision of suburban conformity and marital estrangement, it excavates from the widening distance between two people a set of aching, nuanced truths about the distances between all of us. James Salter\u2019s Light Years (1975) presents a time-lapse portrait of a marriage and its dissolution over the course of 20 years, following Nedra and Viri through pleasure and estrangement. The novel explores the fundamental opacity of other people, describing the consciousness of another person as \u201cmysterious, it is like a forest\u201d \u2013 something you can comprehend from a distance, but that splinters up-close into bewildering light and shadow. It\u2019s a painful novel, but has beautiful moments: apples and wood-handled knives on a picnic, fretted by sun-dappled shade. It\u2019s an image of pleasure from before the marriage sours, insisting that this happiness remains a truth embedded in the story, even if it ultimately gives way to loss. In life, we tell the stories of our breakups not only because these stories hurt, but because we want to say: \u201cThis love was. Some part of it remains.\u201d The urge to think or talk or write about broken relationships is constantly shadowed by shame: the shame of dwelling, the shame of lingering, the shame of solipsism \u2013 the fear that it is somehow weak or useless to spend too much time in the past, that it narrows or forecloses the world. In Edna St Vincent Millay\u2019s poem \u201cOnly Until This Cigarette Is Ended\u201d, the speaker grants herself a single cigarette-length span of nostalgia \u2013 \u201cI will permit my memory to recall / The vision of you\u201d \u2013 as if she needs to ration her access to some guilty pleasure. In her poem \u201cThe Glass Essay\u201d, Anne Carson finds language not just for the devastation of heartbreak but for the shame of being too devastated by it. It\u2019s a poem anchored by the end of a five-year relationship: \u201cNot enough spin on it, / he said of our five years of love. / Inside my chest I felt my heart snap into two pieces / which floated apart \u2026 \u201d In the aftermath, the speaker\u2019s mother becomes a mouthpiece for the idea that one can dwell too long: \u201cYou remember too much, / my mother said to me recently. / Why hold onto that? And I said, / Where can I put it down?\u201d Literary accounts of broken relationships not only try to \u201chold onto that\u201d by transcribing or inventing stories of lost or soured love, they also try to answer the question of why it\u2019s worth holding on in the first place. It\u2019s one of the great reckonings at the heart of literature itself: can we extract meaning from what hurts? And when does that attempt verge into self-serving delusion or come up against its own limits? Randall Jarrell famously outlined the sceptical take in his poem \u201c90 North\u201d: \u201cPain comes from the darkness / And we call it wisdom. It is pain.\u201d Nevertheless, we keep seeking that wisdom. In his poem \u201cEurydice\u201d, Ocean Vuong describes this painful illumination as \u201cgravity breaking / our kneecaps just to show us the sky\u201d. Nowhere do we seek the sky as pointedly or hopelessly as we do in stories of lost love. In \u201cThe Glass Essay\u201d, Carson doesn\u2019t dramatise the process of recovering from heartbreak so much as she documents the anguished mess of making meaning from it \u2013 or rather, struggling with the proposition that it holds any meaning at all. Perhaps her kneecaps have been broken, but she is no longer sure what sky she lives under: \u201cIn the days and months after Law left / I felt as if the sky was torn off my life.\u201d Yet Carson suggests that heartbreak can sharpen and even broaden your gaze, rather than narrowing it, overturning the presumption that a broken heart will inevitably make you self-consumed and self-obsessed. The speaker observes that while her mother always closes her bedroom curtains, \u201cI open mine as wide as possible. / I like to see everything.\u201d A resonant quality of expansive attention is one of the defining features of Maggie Nelson\u2019s Bluets, a cult classic that is at once a \u201cbreakup story\u201d and a text that resists both parts of that phrase. It\u2019s neither a traditionally structured story \u2013 instead the book is composed as an arrangement of numbered, ruminative fragments called \u201cpropositions\u201d \u2013 nor is it exclusively about a breakup. The form is making an argument about the nature of heartbreak: life is never just one thing at once.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.adamkay.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Adam Kay</a> is a writer, comedian and former junior doctor. His memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/04/this-is-going-to-hurt-secret-diaries-of-a-junior-doctor-by-adam-kay-review\" title=\"\"><em>This Is Going </em><em>to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor</em></a> was the bestselling nonfiction title of last year, with more than 1.5m copies sold and a record-breaking 52 weeks at No 1. He is currently adapting the book into a series for BBC Two while touring the UK with his highly acclaimed standup show. His forthcoming book, <em>Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas</em>, follows Kay through six festive seasons on hospital wards.</p> <p><strong><em>This Is Going </em></strong><strong><em>to Hurt </em>has been a publishing phenomenon. Why do you think it\u2019s resonated with people so much?</strong><br>I think partly the book\u2019s a confidence trick. It sells itself as a funny book and it is mostly a funny book but, actually, I\u2019m using humour to tell the story of what it\u2019s like to be a junior doctor. And I think people are genuinely interested in looking under that particular bonnet: on television the vast majority of dramas are crime, medicine or sex. So that\u2019s one side of it. On the other side, the book\u2019s very much a love letter to the NHS. I think we\u2019re rightly proud of the NHS, and I think it\u2019s in peril.</p> <p><strong>Given how much love there is for the NHS</strong><strong>, why do you think it\u2019s been allowed to get to this stage?</strong><br>The NHS needs to be above politics. It needs big, cross-party decisions where politicians can do big, brave things \u2013 then they can chuck two pence on tax and not worry about whether they\u2019re going to lose their job in a few years\u2019 time.</p> <p><strong>What do think </strong><strong>of the government\u2019s recent </strong><strong>NHS funding pledge?</strong><br>Any extra pound spent on the NHS is a good thing, whatever my views on the politician who announces it. It\u2019s not enough and it\u2019s far too late, but any new money has my backing.</p> <p><strong>Both your memoirs are drawn from </strong><strong> notes you made while working as a junior doctor. Are your original clinical notes funny?</strong><br>Yes, it was my pressure release valve. In the absence of a culture that taught you how to cope \u2013 which it doesn\u2019t \u2013 this was my strategy. It was going up to my hospital on-call room and writing down the silly things, the disgusting things, the funny things. And I didn\u2019t really know this was why I was doing it, but in retrospect it\u2019s totally clear: I was looking for the shards of light among the dark.</p> <p><strong>The memoirs are both hilarious and heartbreaking...</strong><br>That\u2019s what the job is. I\u2019ve not invented the genre of the medical memoir, but I think medical books either become a drama or a sitcom, and I don\u2019t think either of those is true.</p> <p><strong>What has been the response of junior doctors to the book?</strong><br>Simply overwhelming. The messages that really move me are the ones from healthcare professionals telling me they thought they were the only one who was struggling like this, in the same way that I thought I was the only one who couldn\u2019t cope, the only person who ever cried in the toilet. We need to recognise that doctors are humans. And that\u2019s really what my books are about. Doctors aren\u2019t robots, they\u2019re people who get sick and who make mistakes and who get sad.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think the medical profession doesn\u2019t have adequate emotional and psychological support for its staff?</strong><br>It baffles me. Medicine is still a very old-fashioned speciality. It\u2019s militaristic and hierarchical and patrician. It\u2019s a culture of stiff upper lip. And changing a culture: that\u2019s an enormous ship to steer.</p> <p><strong>Are you ever worried your memoirs might put people off entering the profession?</strong><br>I get angry messages from people saying that their son wanted to be a doctor but then they read my book, and now they don\u2019t want to any more. Good. I mean, would you honestly rather they discovered that they didn\u2019t want to be a doctor seven years later, when they\u2019re working on the wards? If my book\u2019s going to put you off being a doctor, then being a doctor is <em>really</em> going to put you off being a doctor.</p> <p><strong>Do you miss being a doctor?</strong><br>I miss it hugely. I miss helping people. Even though I was frequently home late, still wearing my scrubs, still with the blood that I didn\u2019t have the time to wipe off, and winding the window down in the car just so I stay awake: you still have a smile on your face because there is nothing like that feeling of saving a life. I miss that, and I miss being useful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/12/every-tory-mp-sent-this-is-going-to-hurt-as-reminder-of-jeremy-hunts-record\">Every Tory MP sent This Is Going to Hurt as reminder of Jeremy Hunt's record</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>You\u2019ve been vocal about </strong><strong>how inadequate the selection process for medical students is</strong><strong>.

      "bodyText": "Adam Kay is a writer, comedian and former junior doctor. His memoir This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor was the bestselling nonfiction title of last year, with more than 1.5m copies sold and a record-breaking 52 weeks at No 1. He is currently adapting the book into a series for BBC Two while touring the UK with his highly acclaimed standup show. His forthcoming book, Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas, follows Kay through six festive seasons on hospital wards. This Is Going to Hurt has been a publishing phenomenon. Why do you think it\u2019s resonated with people so much? I think partly the book\u2019s a confidence trick. It sells itself as a funny book and it is mostly a funny book but, actually, I\u2019m using humour to tell the story of what it\u2019s like to be a junior doctor. And I think people are genuinely interested in looking under that particular bonnet: on television the vast majority of dramas are crime, medicine or sex. So that\u2019s one side of it. On the other side, the book\u2019s very much a love letter to the NHS. I think we\u2019re rightly proud of the NHS, and I think it\u2019s in peril. Given how much love there is for the NHS, why do you think it\u2019s been allowed to get to this stage? The NHS needs to be above politics. It needs big, cross-party decisions where politicians can do big, brave things \u2013 then they can chuck two pence on tax and not worry about whether they\u2019re going to lose their job in a few years\u2019 time. What do think of the government\u2019s recent NHS funding pledge? Any extra pound spent on the NHS is a good thing, whatever my views on the politician who announces it. It\u2019s not enough and it\u2019s far too late, but any new money has my backing. Both your memoirs are drawn from notes you made while working as a junior doctor. Are your original clinical notes funny? Yes, it was my pressure release valve. In the absence of a culture that taught you how to cope \u2013 which it doesn\u2019t \u2013 this was my strategy. It was going up to my hospital on-call room and writing down the silly things, the disgusting things, the funny things. And I didn\u2019t really know this was why I was doing it, but in retrospect it\u2019s totally clear: I was looking for the shards of light among the dark. The memoirs are both hilarious and heartbreaking... That\u2019s what the job is. I\u2019ve not invented the genre of the medical memoir, but I think medical books either become a drama or a sitcom, and I don\u2019t think either of those is true. What has been the response of junior doctors to the book? Simply overwhelming. The messages that really move me are the ones from healthcare professionals telling me they thought they were the only one who was struggling like this, in the same way that I thought I was the only one who couldn\u2019t cope, the only person who ever cried in the toilet. We need to recognise that doctors are humans. And that\u2019s really what my books are about. Doctors aren\u2019t robots, they\u2019re people who get sick and who make mistakes and who get sad. Why do you think the medical profession doesn\u2019t have adequate emotional and psychological support for its staff? It baffles me. Medicine is still a very old-fashioned speciality. It\u2019s militaristic and hierarchical and patrician. It\u2019s a culture of stiff upper lip. And changing a culture: that\u2019s an enormous ship to steer. Are you ever worried your memoirs might put people off entering the profession? I get angry messages from people saying that their son wanted to be a doctor but then they read my book, and now they don\u2019t want to any more. Good. I mean, would you honestly rather they discovered that they didn\u2019t want to be a doctor seven years later, when they\u2019re working on the wards? If my book\u2019s going to put you off being a doctor, then being a doctor is really going to put you off being a doctor. Do you miss being a doctor? I miss it hugely. I miss helping people. Even though I was frequently home late, still wearing my scrubs, still with the blood that I didn\u2019t have the time to wipe off, and winding the window down in the car just so I stay awake: you still have a smile on your face because there is nothing like that feeling of saving a life. I miss that, and I miss being useful. You\u2019ve been vocal about how inadequate the selection process for medical students is. How could it be improved? You would probably drop the A-level requirement from straight As because it\u2019s not a brainbox profession. You need to be logical and analytical, you don\u2019t need to be Alain de Botton. It\u2019s a communication job: the best doctors you\u2019ve come across will be the best communicators, not the people who memorised the most biochemical pathways. Do you have a favourite medical memoir? When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi is a wonderful piece of writing \u2013 a brilliant neurosurgeon confronting his own death in his 30s. It\u2019s deeply affecting and thought-provoking and yet somehow manages to also be inspiring. What do you make of the current slew of medical memoirs, and do you feel responsible? I think it\u2019s wonderful that readers are keen to find out more about healthcare professions, and that so many brilliant people are telling their stories. I think it\u2019s slightly less wonderful when publishers decide to copy my book\u2019s cover or back-cover blurb, but I guess imitation is the sincerest form of being a dick. \u2022 Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas by Adam Kay will be published by Pan Macmillan on 17 October (\u00a39.99).

      "bodyText": "Robert Kitson was in the Tokyo Stadium to see England score six tries en route to a fairly straightforward victory over an Argentina team reduced to 14 men inside 20 minutes. Here\u2019s how he saw the action unfold. The Lavanini sending-off: Here it is, for anyone who might be intrigued by what happened. Can you imagine a footballer listening to a referee\u2019s explanation, taking the card and walking off without complaint like that? Nope, me neither. England\u2019s bench: As an Ireland fan, it hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by me that there are players on our bench that clearly aren\u2019t trusted by our coach, Joe Schmidt. This clearly isn\u2019t a problem for England, who have astonishing strength in depth in their squad. All eight players on their bench ooze quality, while there are another eight players who weren\u2019t in today\u2019s match-day squad who wouldn\u2019t look even remotely out of place in the starting line-up. Rob Kitson speaks: Well, tweets. What did the Guardian\u2019s man in Tokyo make of England\u2019s performance. George Ford speaks: \u201cWe\u2019re happy with the result but there are areas we can do better in and that\u2019s the exciting thing,\u201d says England\u2019s fly-half in a chat with ITV. On playing against 14 men, he makes an interesting point. \u201cThere\u2019s potentially more space on the field which can seduce you a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re tempted to do things you don\u2019t need to do. In the second half we wanted to simplify our game and not be seduced. We wanted to get our ball-carriers involved and play through the lines. And that\u2019s what we did.\u201d The ITV view: In the ITV studio, Jonny Wilkinson, Clive Woodward and Lawrence Dallaglio allseem to be of a mind that Eddie Jones will be largely pleased with this performance ahead of England\u2019s next game, against France next Saturday at 9.15am (BST). England injury concerns: Both Joe Marler and Billy Vunipola succumbed to injuries in this game and the seriousness of their ailments will be closely assessed in the coming days. Marler looks like he might have damaged a hamstring, while Vunipola did a mischief to his ankle that forced him off at half-time. England secure their quarter-final place: It was a curate\u2019s egg of a performance from the English players - good in spots, but with plenty of room for improvement after a disjointed, scrappy performance. Their task was made easier by the first half dismissal of Argentina second-row Tomas Lavanini and they scored six tries en route to becoming the first team to qualify for the knockout stages. France will join them if they beat Tonga tomorrow. Owen Farrell takes the last kick of the game, slotting the ball between the posts for the conversion and sealing a comfortable win for England in the process. 80+1 min: Both sets of players get involved in some \u201cafters\u201d, while Nigel Owens clucks disapprovingly at them like a farmyard hen. We\u2019re still waiting for the conversion attempt. England drive over from about 10 metres out for their sixth try of the game. The man at the bottom of the pile of bodies receiving congratulatory pats on the head is Luke Cowan-Dickie. 78 min: We\u2019re nearing full-time and the end of Argentina\u2019s interest in this tournament. They\u2019re capable of better than they\u2019ve shown today, but were hamstrung by the dismissal of second-row Tomas Lavanini for a high tackle after 18 or 19 minutes. They were always on a hiding to nothing after that, but even so ... too many of their key players have failed to deliver. Excellent play from Jack Nowell after Jonny May breaks the Argentina line with a dash through the centre. The ball\u2019s played wide out to Nowell by Farrell and the substitute cannons into three opposition players, bounces away from them and breaks through another tackle to touch down in the corner. Farrell\u2019s conversion kick goes over, taking a bounce off the left upright on its way. 74 min: That was a nice try by Argentina, but an appalling lapse in concentration by England\u2019s players that is likely to displease their head coach Eddie Jones no end. They should be 30 or more points clear in this game ... 72 min: Given up, eh? After some neat passing by assorted Argentinians, Matias Moroni exploits a gap in the England defence, steps out of a last-ditch tackle by Manu Tuilagi and goes over under the posts for Argentina. The try is converted. 69 min: It\u2019s difficult to avoid the conclusion that England might have been better off if Argentina hadn\u2019t had a man sent off inside 20 minutes. This has been too easy for them; they could be ahead by a lot more and they\u2019re now looking very flat and uninspired against a team that has more or less given up. 68 min: Henry Slade comes on for George Ford, who\u2019s had a good game. Jack Nowell replaces Anthony Watson on the wing. England have now emptied their bench. 66 min: Courtney Lawes is late with a charge-down, doesn\u2019t get the ball and catches Emiliano Boffelli with a late one. Penalty for Argentina, who think Lawes should get a yellow card for his troubles as well. Boffelli kicks for the corner and Lawes wins the lineout. England are back in possession. 64 min: Argentina miss a kick into the corner after England are penalised for collapsing the scrum. Mako Vunipola the guilty party, going down under pressure from Agustin Creevy. Luke Cowan-Dickie comes off the England bench to replace hooker Jamie George. 62 min: Dan Cole comes on for his 92nd cap, replacing Kyle Sinckler. In slightly worrying news for England, Joe Marler goes off looking like he might have done a mischief to his hamstring. He\u2019s replaced by Mako Vunipola. 61 min: Mensa ... brains. Eh? Eh? I\u2019ll get my coat. 60 min: Argentina fly-half Benjamin Urdapilleta has not had one of his better games and goes off, to be replaced by Lucas Mensa, who will now be the brains of the Argentina operation. 58 min: THere\u2019s a break in play as Argentina scrum-half Tomas Cubelli receives treatment before being helped off by two of his side\u2019s backroom staff. I must confess, I don\u2019t know how he came a cropper, but it looks like his his World Cup is over. Felipe Ezcurra replaces him. Well, I\u2019m presuming he does, I haven\u2019t actually seen him come on yet. 56 min: Courtney Lawes comes off the bench for England with George Kruis making way. There\u2019s a break in play as Nigel Owens gives Joe Marler and Santiago Medrano a telling-off. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any problems in the scrum ... until now,\u201d he says. He tells Marler to not to start misbehaving now, before instructing Medrano to \u201cbuy into the discipline and values your team-mates brought to the front row before going off\u201d. That\u2019s them told. Owen Farrell slots over. On the ITV commentary team, Ugo Monye says he was hoping for a decent contest, but doesn\u2019t feel sorry for Argentina even though they\u2019re down to 14 men. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing the levels of energy or the game management required from them,\u201d he says, He adds that he sees no sign of leadership from their senior players. 52 min: Santiago Carrera gives away a penalty for going off his feet, but Nigel Owens plays advantage. He calls a second advantage when Santiago Medrano strays offside. England penalty on the Argentina 22. 50 min: England are in complete control. George Ford pins them back on their own line with a fine kick to the corner. Argentina win the lineout and clear their lines. 48 min: Willi Heinz comes off the bench to replace Ben Youngs. With Argentina\u2019s players looking increasingly knackered, England are turning the screw. Aregentina change their front row: Agustin Creevy, Mayco Vivas and Santiago Medrano come on for the graveyard shift. Having dragged the Argentina defence from one siade of the pitch to the other. Jonny May goes for the corner and is tackled. Underhill and Tuilagi draw the tacklers with a couple of good carries, before Ford goes over in the corner. Owen Farrell finally gets his cross0-hairs aligned and puts one over. 44 min: England scrum halfway between the halfway line and the Argentina 22. England play it out wide to the right before sending the ball back inside the other way through several pairs of hands. They\u2019re in the Argentina 22, under the posts about 15 metres from the line. 42 min: Argentina lineout on the England 22. England win the turnover and Sam Underhill drives over the gain line and towards halfway for England. 41 min: Play resumes. Billy Vunipola, who suffered an ankle injury towards the end of the first half, has been replaced by Lewis Ludlam. Argentina, who are down to 14 men following the dismissal of Tomas Lavanini, have made no changes yet. England go in for the break with a 12-point lead. It could and should be a lot more. Owen Farrell has missed four kicks at goal, while several promising attacks have broken down on the back of handling errors. Argentina lost Tomas Lavanini to a red card for a high tackle on Farrell and are looking exhausted. You\u2019d expect England to pull further clear as the game goes on and their opponents become increasingly tired. England were lucky not to lose Manu Tuilagi to a yellow card for tackling Emiliano Boffelli while the Argentina full-back was airborne and off his feet. After a surge towards the line from Man Tuilagi, Billy Vunipola takes the ball from the bottom of the ruck and passes to Ben Youngs. He spots a gap and nips through to touch down, with Pablo Matero missing the tackle for Argentina. Owen Farrell makes it zero from four on the kicking front, missing his conversion attempt. 40+2 min: England lay siege to the Argentina line, having gone through 20 phases of play. 40 min: The half-time gong sounds and the clock goes red. England continue going through the phases in a bid to put a little more hurt on Argentina before the break. 38 min: The humidity in the Tokyo air tonight means the ball is like a bar of soap. At least that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying in the ITV commentary box, in a bid to excuse England\u2019s myriad handling errors. I make it six so far - it\u2019s costing them points. 35 min: Nigel Owens is warning the Argentina players not to handle the ball. England send the ball out wide - George Ford swings it towards Elliot Daly, juggles it before gaining control and cutting inside two Argentinians and going over. Owen Farrell misses yet another kick, hitting the post with his conversion attempt. 35 min: England are camped on the Argentina line. 34 min: Good play from England, who are now just a couple of metres from the Argentina line. 32 min: England scrum halfway inside their own half. They win a penalty and George Ford kicks for touch. From the ensuing lineout, the ball goes from one set of hands to the other out the line, with Anthony Watson finding Daly. 31 min: Thirty minutes in and Argentina are ahead, but looking very fatigued already. They\u2019re a man down and England are dominating possession and keeping the ball in play as much as possible in a bid to tire them out. 30 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Billy Vunipola receives medical attention. 30 min: Owen Farrell sprints on to a pass from George Ford but drops it after good build-up play from Billy Vunipola and Kyle Sinckler up front. 29 min: England have possession, but Elliot Daly is tackled near halfway by Javier Ortego Desio. 28 min: Down to 14 men, Argentina win a lineout and have ball in hand on halfway. Centre Matias Orlando runs on to a pop pass and charges into a wall of England muscle. 25 min: On the ITV commentary team, my colleague the Guardian columnist Ugo Monye explains that England are kicking the ball down the centre rather than going for touch in order to keep it in play, so that any wayward kicks from Boffelli will enable the likes of May, Watson and Daly to get their engines revving and put the opposition under extreme pressure. 24 min: England scrum, just inside their own half. George Ford kicks down the middle and Argentina full-back gathers Emiliano Boffelli. His kick for touch is sublime. 21 min: The game has been going for 30 minutes, but only 21 have actually been played. There have been no injuries, which more or less means that Nigel Owens has been yapping for the other nine. 20 min: Manu Tuilagi tackles Emiliano Boffelli just before the Argentina full-back lands on the ground after catching a high ball. Argentina\u2019s players appeal for a card for the England centre, but Nigel Owens says the tackle was only slightly late and a penalty will have to suffice. It\u2019s not in kicking range. 18 min: Nigel Owens is keeping busy and after sending off Lavanini, he admonishes England\u2019s players, informing them he doesn\u2019t need them to tell him to refer to the big screen in a bid to get opposition players penalised. Nobody likes a grass, as they say. Owen Farrell misses the penalty England were awarded on the back of Lavanini\u2019s high tackle. Argentina are down to 14 men as Tomas Lavanini becomes the fifth player to be shown a red card in this tournament. Nigel Owens and his TMO can see no mitigating factors to keep him on the field. He was high, he led with his shoulder and caught Farrell on the head. He walks for the touchline and looks absolutely distraught. It\u2019s the correct decision, but I don\u2019t think there was too much malice in the tackle. 17 min: A huge hit by second-row Tomas Lavanini on Owen Farrell should knock the England centre into the middle week. It\u2019s high! Nigel Owens goes to his TMO. 15 min: England keep the Argentinians under pressure, but a handling error gifts possession to the men from South America, who clear their lines courtesy of Matias Moroni\u2019s boot. He kicks long, but doesn\u2019t find touch. Elliot Daly gathers and England advance again. 13 min: Elliot Daly plays the ball out to Anthony Watson on the right touchline, but he\u2019s brought to ground by Benjamin Urdapilleta. Argentina win possession just outside their own 22, but a knock on by prop Juan Figallo gives the scrum to England. 13 min: Hurrah! The air turns blue with plenty of effing and jeffing as England win the scrum against the head before Pablo Matero catches Owen Farrell with a late tackle. A mass brawl ensues, but its little more than handbags. Nigel Owens urges both captains to tell their players to behave themselves. 12 min: Argentina scrum on the England 22, which takes a while to set up. \u201cA little less talking and a little more scrummaging, please lads,\u201d says Nigel Owens, admonishing both sets of forwards. England hit back immediately. A drive for the Argentina line after a good take from Mario Itoje was stopped illegally. With a penalty to fall back on, England have a freebie and play the ball out to the wing. Jonny May goes over in the corner after George Ford had drawn two tacklers before finding his teammate out by the touchline. Owen Farrell pulls his conversion wide of the left upright. England 0-3 Argentina: Benjamin Urdapilleta ahead with the penalty. England are behind, but things could be worse for them. 6 min: With England under extreme pressure, Elliot Daly puts in a brilliant tackle to prevent Santiago Carreras going over in the corner. Referee Nigel Owens takes Owen Farrell to one side and points out three different penalties his team could have conceded in the build-up to that tackle. Argentina get one of those penalties for a no-arms tackle by Kyle Sinckler. Owens tells Farrell to warn his players that there\u2019s a yellow card in the post. 4 min: Two brilliant kicks from Argentina after a knock-on from Billy Vunipola. First Urdapilleta sends Matias Moroni on his way with ball in hand with an excellent kick from deep. The winger makes serious ground up the centre and kicks for the English try line. It\u2019s a foot race between him and Jonny May, which the Englishman wins. He gathers and brings the ball over his own line before touching down. Excellent stuff from Argentina, who have a five-metre scrum. 2 min: A box kick from Argentina scrum-half Tomas Cubelli and Argentina are penalised for offside as they chase the dropping ball. England win a line-out on halfway as Urdapilleta puts the ball into touch. 1 min: Nigel blows his whistle and Benjamin Urdapilleta kicks off for Argentina. Ben Youngs takes the ball from the back of the ensuing ruck and kicks up the field. Argentina take possession and go through the phases as they make their way up the centre of the pitch. Here we go: The sides make their way out on to the pitch, England\u2019s players wearing red shirts with navy shoulders, navy shorts and red and navy socks. Argentina\u2019s wear light blue and white striped shirts, white shorts and light bluer and white striped socks. They line up either side of referee Nigel Owens and his team of match officials for the national anthems. Not too long now: We\u2019re brought into the bowels of the stadium, where Argentina\u2019s players are leaving the dressing room. The substitutes are making a ferocious din, geeing up the starting XV as they prepare for this do-or-die game. Anything less than victory will reduce the status of their match against the USA next week to that of dead rubber. After a week\u2019s worth of one-sided contests in this Rugby World Cup, here\u2019s hoping we get a closely fought contest here. For me, Clive: \u201cIf every single player plays at their optimal level, England should win this game,\u201d says Sir Clive Woodward in his role as pundit on ITV. It\u2019s a controversial opinion and no mistake. Clive is in the studio with his fellow World Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny Wilkinson. Head coach Mario Ledesma must mastermind victory over England today if his side are to have any chance of making the quarter-finals. He has made just one change to the team that started their most recvent game against Togo, with No8, Javier Ortega Desio replacing Tomas Lezana at the back of the scrum. Fly-half Nicolas Sanchez is not in the match-day 23, despite not missing an Argentina game since October 2016. Benjamin Urdapilleta will be pulling the strings today. Argentina: 15 Emiliano Boffelli, 14 Matas Moroni, 13 Matias Orlando, 12 Jeronimo De La Fuente, 11 Santiago Carreras, 10 Benjamin Urdapilleta, 9 Toms Cubelli, 1 Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro, 2 Julian Montoya, 3 Juan Figallo, 4 Guido Petti, 5 Tomas Lavanini, 6 Pablo Matera (captain), 7 Marcos Kremer, 8 Javier Ortega Desio. Replacements: 16 Agustin Creevy, 17 Mayco Vivas, 18 Santiago Medrano, 19 Matias Alemanno, 20 Tomas Lezana, 21 Felipe Ezcurra, 22 Lucas Mensa, 23 Bautista Delguy. England team news Having rotated his squad for England\u2019s win over the USA, Eddie Jones reverts back to something approaching his strongest starting XV. With a full squad to choose from, he makes one change to the side that beat Tonga in their opening match, with Saracens\u2019 George Kruis coming in for Courtney Lawes in the second row. England: 15 Elliot Daly, 14 Anthony Watson, 13 Manu Tuilagi, 12 Owen Farrell (c), 11 Jonny May, 10 George Ford, 9 Ben Youngs, 1 Joe Marler, 2 Jamie George, 3 Kyle Sinckler, 4 Maro Itoje, 5 George Kruis, 6 Tom Curry, 7 Sam Underhill, 8 Billy Vunipola. Replacements: 16 Luke Cowan-Dickie, 17 Mako Vunipola, 18 Dan Cole, 19 Courtney Lawes, 20 Lewis Ludlam, 21 Willi Heinz, 22 Henry Slade, 23 Jack Nowell. Eddie Jones speaks: While England are white-hot favourites to win comfortably today, their head coach is not taking today\u2019s opponents lightly. They are desperate to win, after all. \u201cArgentina base their game on the scrum,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a test of manlihood so you have to take them on up-front \u2013 scrum, maul, ruck attack, ruck defence. That\u2019s where it will be won.\u201d He is, however, pleased with his own team\u2019s preparations. \u201cEveryone trained really well this morning,\u201d he said yesterday. \u201cThey\u2019re looking fit, fast, brutal and ready to go. There are no last minute messages. The players are well prepared. They know what to do, now they just have to go out there and do it.\u201d The Tokyo Stadium is the venue for England\u2019s match against Argentina. WIth two wins from two under their belts, victory for Eddie Jones\u2019s men will all but secure their place in the quarter-finals. Following their opening defeat by France, Argentina must win to keep their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages alive. Kick-off is at 9am (BST), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

      "body": "<p>Zen masters believe in the concept of existing in the present moment rather than worrying unduly about the future. England seem to be adopting a similar strategy in Japan, focusing purely on the here and now. Three successive bonus-point victories and qualification for the knockout stages with a game to spare have kept their supporters\u2019 stress levels remarkably low.</p> \n<p>Maybe it would have been different had Argentina not been required to play three-quarters of the match with 14 men, having had their second-row enforcer Tom\u00e1s Lavinini sent off after 18 minutes for a high tackle on Owen Farrell. Or maybe not. The manner in which England finished, scoring two tries in the final six minutes to add a coat of gloss to the final scoreline, suggested they would have had too much for the Pumas even if Lavanini had hung around slightly longer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"725b9d645ab31bcc3bb2a44d4696723d4646d25a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/725b9d645ab31bcc3bb2a44d4696723d4646d25a/588_44_3055_1833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Owens sends off Tom\u00e1s Lavanini with Argentina trailing only 5-3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Owens sends off Tom\u00e1s Lavanini (centre) with Argentina trailing only 5-3.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To a large extent it leaves England where they wanted to be, with just a couple of slight nagging concerns before Saturday\u2019s final pool fixture against France in Yokohama.</p> \n<p>One is the twisted ankle sustained by Billy Vunipola that curtailed his involvement at half-time. Privately, though, Jones may be more concerned by a less visible issue. For assorted reasons \u2013 opposition, luck of the draw, circumstances \u2013 England have now been in Japan a month and still did not really know whether their title chances are any better or worse than when they flew in.</p> \n<p>For the third game in a row they should probably have won by a wider margin, could have played with more consistent rhythm and generally found their snappiest form elusive. On another day Farrell\u2019s first-half goal-kicking inaccuracy \u2013 he missed four from four attempts before retuning his radar in the second half \u2013 might have been more costly and England\u2019s centre pairing would collectively have asked rather more attacking questions.</p> \n<p>But, then again, they did not have to. The Pumas have not had an auspicious tournament and their shortage of fly-half generalship has been glaring. How they could have done with a Spanish-speaking George Ford to pull a few strings or even replacements of the calibre of Luke Cowan-Dickie, Jack Nowell and Henry Slade to ask different questions. It may or may not have been coincidental that England perked up after the Exeter trio came on, with Cowan-Dickie and Nowell collecting late scores as a further bonus.</p> \n<p>England\u2019s management will also have been pleased with the prodigious defensive appetite of Sam Underhill while Elliot Daly had one of his best games in England\u2019s No 15 jersey. It was a far cry from the last time these sides met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/26/england-argentina-autumn-internationals-match-report\" title=\"\">when Daly was the man to receive an early red card</a>. On that occasion his side still won but with Lavanini such a central pillar of the Pumas\u2019 pack there was never any danger of a repeat here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Argentina coach, Mario Ledesma, made no attempt to defend his man, despite the fact Farrell was stooping slightly at the moment of impact. Had the fly-half been standing upright it might have been a legal hit but players are now expected to allow some margin for error and, even at 6ft 7in tall, Lavinini should have been aiming lower in the first instance.</p> \n<p>It was not just the raucous Argentina fans who felt instantly deflated on a warm, sultry evening. The previously bubbling atmosphere around the ground completely disappeared, as so often happens when an underdog side receives such an early setback.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902aaaqN0IIA1YQ/\" data-alt=\"Owen Farrell's kicks\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902aaaqN0IIA1YQ/\">Owen Farrell's kicks</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Before England finally began to exploit their numerical advantage, Argentina did at least show some defiance. Pablo Matera clattered late into Ben Youngs, prompting a bit of old-fashioned argy-bargy, and Vunipola\u2019s injury also seemed to distract his teammates. It was just as well that Jonny May had already nudged England ahead, the winger\u2019s early score nicely served up for him by a scampering George Ford.</p> \n<p>Daly, after an initial juggle, also showed good pace to get around his opposite number Emiliano Boffelli and Ben Youngs added a close-range third just before half-time to mark his 92nd cap, a tally that puts him third on England\u2019s Test appearance list alongside his Leicester colleague Dan Cole.</p> \n<p>England\u2019s interval lead of 15-3 would have looked rather more comfortable had Farrell brought his kicking boots but even with three specialist flankers in the back row following Vunipola\u2019s departure the result was never remotely in doubt. Ford, alert as ever, dived over for the bonus point score five minutes after the restart and Farrell, finally back in the groove, added the conversion and a subsequent penalty.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/05/england-argentina-rugby-world-cup-player-ratings\">England 39-10 Argentina: Rugby World Cup player ratings</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A 70th-minute try for the winger Mat\u00edas Moroni, assisted by a missed tackle in the build-up by the returning Mako Vunipola, could not obscure a forgettable night for a frustrated Argentina, who last failed to qualify for the knockout stages of a Rugby World Cup in 2003. Their only other faint consolation was an 88th cap off the bench for their captain Agust\u00edn Creevy, making him the most-capped player in his country\u2019s history.</p> \n<p>England, in contrast, are already safely into the quarters, having failed to do so on home soil in 2015. There will be a bit of conjecture about whether they would be better finishing second in Pool C rather than top but the solution to that puzzle is, ultimately, straightforward. Keep winning and, as the zen masters say, the future will look after itself.</p>",

Maybe it would have been different had Argentina not been required to play three-quarters of the match with 14 men, having had their second-row enforcer Tom\u00e1s Lavinini sent off after 18 minutes for a high tackle on Owen Farrell. Or maybe not. The manner in which England finished, scoring two tries in the final six minutes to add a coat of gloss to the final scoreline, suggested they would have had too much for the Pumas even if Lavanini had hung around slightly longer. To a large extent it leaves England where they wanted to be, with just a couple of slight nagging concerns before Saturday\u2019s final pool fixture against France in Yokohama. One is the twisted ankle sustained by Billy Vunipola that curtailed his involvement at half-time. Privately, though, Jones may be more concerned by a less visible issue. For assorted reasons \u2013 opposition, luck of the draw, circumstances \u2013 England have now been in Japan a month and still did not really know whether their title chances are any better or worse than when they flew in. For the third game in a row they should probably have won by a wider margin, could have played with more consistent rhythm and generally found their snappiest form elusive. On another day Farrell\u2019s first-half goal-kicking inaccuracy \u2013 he missed four from four attempts before retuning his radar in the second half \u2013 might have been more costly and England\u2019s centre pairing would collectively have asked rather more attacking questions. But, then again, they did not have to. The Pumas have not had an auspicious tournament and their shortage of fly-half generalship has been glaring. How they could have done with a Spanish-speaking George Ford to pull a few strings or even replacements of the calibre of Luke Cowan-Dickie, Jack Nowell and Henry Slade to ask different questions. It may or may not have been coincidental that England perked up after the Exeter trio came on, with Cowan-Dickie and Nowell collecting late scores as a further bonus. England\u2019s management will also have been pleased with the prodigious defensive appetite of Sam Underhill while Elliot Daly had one of his best games in England\u2019s No 15 jersey. It was a far cry from the last time these sides met when Daly was the man to receive an early red card. On that occasion his side still won but with Lavanini such a central pillar of the Pumas\u2019 pack there was never any danger of a repeat here. The Argentina coach, Mario Ledesma, made no attempt to defend his man, despite the fact Farrell was stooping slightly at the moment of impact. Had the fly-half been standing upright it might have been a legal hit but players are now expected to allow some margin for error and, even at 6ft 7in tall, Lavinini should have been aiming lower in the first instance. It was not just the raucous Argentina fans who felt instantly deflated on a warm, sultry evening. The previously bubbling atmosphere around the ground completely disappeared, as so often happens when an underdog side receives such an early setback. Before England finally began to exploit their numerical advantage, Argentina did at least show some defiance. Pablo Matera clattered late into Ben Youngs, prompting a bit of old-fashioned argy-bargy, and Vunipola\u2019s injury also seemed to distract his teammates. It was just as well that Jonny May had already nudged England ahead, the winger\u2019s early score nicely served up for him by a scampering George Ford. Daly, after an initial juggle, also showed good pace to get around his opposite number Emiliano Boffelli and Ben Youngs added a close-range third just before half-time to mark his 92nd cap, a tally that puts him third on England\u2019s Test appearance list alongside his Leicester colleague Dan Cole. England\u2019s interval lead of 15-3 would have looked rather more comfortable had Farrell brought his kicking boots but even with three specialist flankers in the back row following Vunipola\u2019s departure the result was never remotely in doubt. Ford, alert as ever, dived over for the bonus point score five minutes after the restart and Farrell, finally back in the groove, added the conversion and a subsequent penalty. A 70th-minute try for the winger Mat\u00edas Moroni, assisted by a missed tackle in the build-up by the returning Mako Vunipola, could not obscure a forgettable night for a frustrated Argentina, who last failed to qualify for the knockout stages of a Rugby World Cup in 2003. Their only other faint consolation was an 88th cap off the bench for their captain Agust\u00edn Creevy, making him the most-capped player in his country\u2019s history. England, in contrast, are already safely into the quarters, having failed to do so on home soil in 2015. There will be a bit of conjecture about whether they would be better finishing second in Pool C rather than top but the solution to that puzzle is, ultimately, straightforward. Keep winning and, as the zen masters say, the future will look after itself.",

Professional life was overwhelmingly skewed male, and there was never any doubt about whose job it was to make the tea when your husband\u2019s clever friends came round to talk about Gramsci. None of this, Todd says, applies to Delaney. She \u201cfailed\u201d the 11-plus, and didn\u2019t try to behave well unless she felt like it. She read comics as well as Chekhov and never thought for a moment that life was supposed to be remotely fair. She turned down the BBC\u2019s desperate invitation to join their drama department, but was quite happy to turn in scripts for Z-Cars for cash. She enjoyed being Albert Finney\u2019s girlfriend, but preferred living alone. Collective action didn\u2019t interest her, but she hoped people noticed how well she could dance. The point, Todd suggests, is that Delaney is much more than an interesting outlier in the official annals of second-wave feminism. She is, rather, the thing itself, in all its unfathomable complexity. \u2022 Tastes of Honey: The Making of Shelagh Delaney and a Cultural Revolution by Selina Todd is published by Vintage (RRP \u00a318.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

After a nerve-racking narrow stretch above a gorge, the route continues, curving round boulders and crossing the river again via stepping stones. Then, there it is \u2013 the Lost Valley or Coire Gabhail, hemmed in by the steep sides of two ridges. Three hundred years ago it made the perfect hiding place for the Macdonald clan\u2019s rustled cattle (its Gaelic name means the Hollow of the Capture).

The bar saw a steady flow of weary walkers who\u2019d just crossed the desolate expanse of Rannoch Moor on stage six of the West Highland Way, and the restaurant menu caters to hikers\u2019 appetites.

There were moments when the landscape was so wild and vast it felt unreal. Yet even here, overtourism is an issue. Coaches clog the A82 and fill the car parks with passengers doing \u201cScotland in a day\u201d \u2013 which is madness given how much there is to explore and how many walks are waiting to be tackled (<a href=\"https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/glencoe.shtml\" title=\"\">Walking Highlands lists 33</a> in Glen Coe and Kinlochleven alone).</p> <p>But walking isn\u2019t the only activity on offer.

Opened in 1956, Glencoe Mountain is the oldest but smallest of Scotland\u2019s five ski resorts, with seven lifts (eight from this winter) serving 20 runs on Meall a\u2019Bhuiridh mountain, including the UK\u2019s steepest black run, the Flypaper. If you\u2019re not there in winter for the skiing \u2013 and conditions can be variable even then \u2013 you can use the lifts to access mountain bike trails for all abilities (May until end of October). Unfortunately, our attempt to ski was scuppered by rain so we headed to the cafe for a hot chocolate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b69a5f8420e14d26f9619fa1be03280e927776d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b69a5f8420e14d26f9619fa1be03280e927776d7/0_7_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walkers on the West Highland Way crossing Rannoch Mor close to the head of Glen Coe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walkers on the West Highland Way crossing Rannoch Mor close to the head of Glen Coe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clearview/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was no chance of poor conditions at our next stop: the <a href=\"https://www.ice-factor.co.uk/\">Ice Factor</a> in Kinlochleven, the world\u2019s largest indoor ice-climbing wall.

      "bodyText": "The Lost Valley of Glen Coe isn\u2019t hard to find. The path to it starts at a car park on the A82, crosses the glen and River Coe, then starts to ascend. After a nerve-racking narrow stretch above a gorge, the route continues, curving round boulders and crossing the river again via stepping stones. Then, there it is \u2013 the Lost Valley or Coire Gabhail, hemmed in by the steep sides of two ridges. Three hundred years ago it made the perfect hiding place for the Macdonald clan\u2019s rustled cattle (its Gaelic name means the Hollow of the Capture). Today, it\u2019s an idyllic spot for walkers and wild campers \u2013 we could just make out a tent on the valley floor. A couple who had passed us earlier, one carrying skis, the other a snowboard, were long gone, presumably up on one of the just-visible patches of snow. Shafts of hazy sunlight shone on the valley floor. In a film the scene would have been set to rousing music. Instead the silence was broken by the persistent buzz of a drone operated by a dad as his teenage daughter sat on a rock staring intently at her phone. Not that I\u2019m judging. We had our own reluctant walker \u2013 our nine-year son, Ossian. \u201cI hate this,\u201d he\u2019d screamed into the wind as we tackled the Devil\u2019s Staircase two days earlier. The route zigzags up the north side of the glen to the highest point of the 96-mile West Highland Way, with views of the Mamores mountains further north. To the east is Aonoch Eagach, the UK\u2019s most exposed ridge walk, just 45cm at its narrowest point. The Devil\u2019s Staircase is so called because some of the men building the nearby Blackwater dam in 1909 didn\u2019t make it home after a night drinking in the Kingshouse Hotel \u2013 the devil \u201cclaimed them\u201d as they staggered back over the pass in the dark. The original hotel is still there, but today it is dwarfed by a modern, three-storey stone and wood extension that opened in April, with 57 bedrooms. The \u00a312m building was roundly criticised by the National Trust, the John Muir Trust and Mountaineering Scotland for not blending in with its surroundings. The design, they said, was too industrial; the John Muir Trust called it a \u201cbarracks-style block.\u201d Which is a bit harsh. The design may not be classic Highlands \u2013 the Clachaig Inn down the road offers that \u2013 but it\u2019s no blot on the landscape. Big windows in the bar and restaurant make the most of the majestic setting, with views of one of Scotland\u2019s most recognisable mountains, the pyramidal Buachaille Etive M\u00f2r. The bar saw a steady flow of weary walkers who\u2019d just crossed the desolate expanse of Rannoch Moor on stage six of the West Highland Way, and the restaurant menu caters to hikers\u2019 appetites. Starters of game broth or double-baked mull cheddar souffl\u00e9 were followed by estate-reared venison or rump of Argyll lamb, with a hot toddy cheesecake to round it off. Glen Coe is a 10-mile valley of brutal beauty. Hulking peaks loom on either side, and fault lines look like a giant claw has slashed the mountainsides from top to bottom. It\u2019s nature at its most forbidding. The 1692 Glen Coe massacre \u2013 when soldiers loyal to William III of England and led by general Robert Campbell turned on the Macdonalds \u2013 is remembered in a film at the revamped National Trust visitor centre, and more bluntly at the entrance to the Clachaig Inn, where a sign reads, \u201cNo Hawkers and no Campbells.\u201d The Clachaig is a whitewashed hotel and pub that stocks 365 malt whiskies, 100 Scottish gins and a roster of craft ales, cider and stouts.

Uruguay were never going to beat the Wallabies. The only question was by how much they would lose.</p> \n<p>In the corresponding game at the 2015 World Cup in England the Wallabies thrashed Uruguay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/27/australia-uruguay-rugby-world-cup-match-report\">65-3</a>. On that comparison this was a sub-par performance. While the Wallabies out-scored Uruguay seven tries to one, if they played with the same lack of intensity and skill execution in a quarter-final, they would be in trouble.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/oct/05/refereeing-mars-australias-rugby-world-cup-win-over-uruguay\">Refereeing mars Australia's Rugby World Cup win over Uruguay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Wallabies tried to play a more direct style, but the game followed a similar, and disturbing, pattern to their first two matches against Fiji and Wales where they started slowly and finished strongly.</p> \n<p>Wallabies coach Michael Cheika joked after the game that he had to improve his pre-match pep talks. Well, Cheika will have to find an answer to this problem before the knock-out stage if Australia is to go deep into the tournament. The Wallabies got away with poor starts against Fiji and Uruguay, but their 29-25 loss to Wales showed they cannot afford to give head-starts to the big teams.</p> \n<p>It may not be the personnel that is the Wallabies\u2019 problem at the start of games, but their mental state. Perhaps they are over-excited or anxious, leading to errors. In the first half it looked as if the Wallabies had learnt nothing from their ill-discipline in relation to attacks to the head in their previous games.</p> \n<p>In the space of 15 minutes two Wallabies forwards \u2013 second rower Adam Coleman and blindside flanker Lukhan Salakaia-Loto \u2013 received yellow cards for high tackles, while fullback Kurtley Beale was penalised for a high shot just a minute before Salakaia-Loto was sent to the sin bin.</p> \n<p>The Wallabies got away with being down to 14 players for 20 minutes of the game against Uruguay. It would not be so easy to play one down against any of the major sides. But it was encouraging to see that the Wallabies did not incur any penalties for high tackles in the second half. Maybe it\u2019s starting to sink in.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb66ee15b363a365c7657cfbd6ca17430214807b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb66ee15b363a365c7657cfbd6ca17430214807b/0_0_2908_2077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Ashley-Cooper breaks away from Felipe Berchesi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Ashley-Cooper breaks away from Felipe Berchesi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is worth keeping in mind that this was not the Wallabies\u2019 first-choice team. Cheika made 12 changes to the team that lost to Wales to give some players much-needed game-time and perhaps to audition others for a place in the team to play the quarter-final.</p> \n<p>The Wallabies entered the game with question marks over several positions, including the halves and back-row combinations. The re-instated halves combination of Nic White and Christian Leallifano was reasonably competent without being brilliant, but they did not have to cope with the kind of physical and mental pressure that a stronger team would put on them.</p> \n<p>After playing well off the bench at five-eighth against Fiji and Wales, Matt Toomua produced a solid performance at inside-centre against Uruguay and remains an option at number 10. Toomua occasionally slipped into first receiver in phase play, but did not play at five-eighth in the set-pieces, which may indicate the selectors are not seriously considering him for the chief playmaker role for the quarter-final - unless they are keeping him under wraps.</p> \n<p>Even though outside-centre Tevita Kuridrani won the player of the match award with two tries against Uruguay, Samu Kerevi is set to reclaim the gold number 12 jersey, which means Toomua is likely to resume his role as a finisher.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cheika split the \u201cPooper\u201d back-row combination of David Pocock and Michael Hooper against Uruguay, bringing Pocock off the bench to give him a rest. This gave Salakaia-Loto and number eight Jack Dempsey an opportunity to press their claims for selection for the quarter-final.</p> \n<p>Despite his size and strength, Salakaia-Loto did not do enough to force his way into the Wallabies\u2019 starting back-row, but Dempsey would have given Cheika and his co-selectors Scott Johnson and Michael O\u2019Connor food for thought. While Dempsey is not as big as Salakaia-Loto, he has the kind of footwork that Cheika salivates over and is very physical and abrasive. It would not surprise to see him find his way onto the bench for the quarter-final.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fixtures-tables-and-results\">Rugby World Cup 2019: fixtures, tables and results</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If there was one really positive aspect of the Uruguay game, it was the highly anticipated debut of boom teenage outside back Jordan Petaia, who showed he is a Test player with a polished performance on the left wing.</p> \n<p>It took the 19-year-old Petaia 23 minutes to receive his first touch of the ball, but 30 seconds later he was over for his first Test try after coming off his wing to take an inside-ball from Beale and beat three defenders.</p> \n<p>It was the first of many tries I suspect for a young player with a big future, but whether Petaia will have a role to play in the quarter-final remains to be seen. He only played the first half, sitting out the second icing his hamstring.</p> \n<p>The Wallabies have one more pool match with Georgia on Friday before Cheika has to settle on the team for the quarter-final, but whoever is selected, the Australians should look to bring the kind of game that will be required in the knockout stage.</p> \n<p>Those games will not be won by cricket scores.</p>",

On that comparison this was a sub-par performance. While the Wallabies out-scored Uruguay seven tries to one, if they played with the same lack of intensity and skill execution in a quarter-final, they would be in trouble. The Wallabies tried to play a more direct style, but the game followed a similar, and disturbing, pattern to their first two matches against Fiji and Wales where they started slowly and finished strongly. Wallabies coach Michael Cheika joked after the game that he had to improve his pre-match pep talks. Well, Cheika will have to find an answer to this problem before the knock-out stage if Australia is to go deep into the tournament. The Wallabies got away with poor starts against Fiji and Uruguay, but their 29-25 loss to Wales showed they cannot afford to give head-starts to the big teams. It may not be the personnel that is the Wallabies\u2019 problem at the start of games, but their mental state. Perhaps they are over-excited or anxious, leading to errors. In the first half it looked as if the Wallabies had learnt nothing from their ill-discipline in relation to attacks to the head in their previous games. In the space of 15 minutes two Wallabies forwards \u2013 second rower Adam Coleman and blindside flanker Lukhan Salakaia-Loto \u2013 received yellow cards for high tackles, while fullback Kurtley Beale was penalised for a high shot just a minute before Salakaia-Loto was sent to the sin bin. The Wallabies got away with being down to 14 players for 20 minutes of the game against Uruguay. It would not be so easy to play one down against any of the major sides. But it was encouraging to see that the Wallabies did not incur any penalties for high tackles in the second half. Maybe it\u2019s starting to sink in. It is worth keeping in mind that this was not the Wallabies\u2019 first-choice team. Cheika made 12 changes to the team that lost to Wales to give some players much-needed game-time and perhaps to audition others for a place in the team to play the quarter-final. The Wallabies entered the game with question marks over several positions, including the halves and back-row combinations. The re-instated halves combination of Nic White and Christian Leallifano was reasonably competent without being brilliant, but they did not have to cope with the kind of physical and mental pressure that a stronger team would put on them. After playing well off the bench at five-eighth against Fiji and Wales, Matt Toomua produced a solid performance at inside-centre against Uruguay and remains an option at number 10. Toomua occasionally slipped into first receiver in phase play, but did not play at five-eighth in the set-pieces, which may indicate the selectors are not seriously considering him for the chief playmaker role for the quarter-final - unless they are keeping him under wraps. Even though outside-centre Tevita Kuridrani won the player of the match award with two tries against Uruguay, Samu Kerevi is set to reclaim the gold number 12 jersey, which means Toomua is likely to resume his role as a finisher. Cheika split the \u201cPooper\u201d back-row combination of David Pocock and Michael Hooper against Uruguay, bringing Pocock off the bench to give him a rest. This gave Salakaia-Loto and number eight Jack Dempsey an opportunity to press their claims for selection for the quarter-final. Despite his size and strength, Salakaia-Loto did not do enough to force his way into the Wallabies\u2019 starting back-row, but Dempsey would have given Cheika and his co-selectors Scott Johnson and Michael O\u2019Connor food for thought. While Dempsey is not as big as Salakaia-Loto, he has the kind of footwork that Cheika salivates over and is very physical and abrasive. It would not surprise to see him find his way onto the bench for the quarter-final. If there was one really positive aspect of the Uruguay game, it was the highly anticipated debut of boom teenage outside back Jordan Petaia, who showed he is a Test player with a polished performance on the left wing. It took the 19-year-old Petaia 23 minutes to receive his first touch of the ball, but 30 seconds later he was over for his first Test try after coming off his wing to take an inside-ball from Beale and beat three defenders. It was the first of many tries I suspect for a young player with a big future, but whether Petaia will have a role to play in the quarter-final remains to be seen. He only played the first half, sitting out the second icing his hamstring. The Wallabies have one more pool match with Georgia on Friday before Cheika has to settle on the team for the quarter-final, but whoever is selected, the Australians should look to bring the kind of game that will be required in the knockout stage. Those games will not be won by cricket scores.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://gordonswinebar.com/\" title=\"\">Gordon\u2019s</a><a href=\"https://gordonswinebar.com/\" title=\"\"> wine bar</a> is reached through a discreet side-door, a few paces from the slipstream of London theatregoers and suited professionals powering towards their evening train. A steep staircase plunges visitors into a dimly lit cavern, lined with dusty champagne bottles and faded newspaper clippings, which appears to have had only minor refurbishment since it opened in 1890. \u201cIf Miss Havisham was in the licensing trade,\u201d an Evening Standard review once suggested, \u201cthis could have been the result.\u201d</p> <p>The bar\u2019s Dickensian gloom is a selling point for people embarking on affairs, and actors or politicians wanting a quiet drink \u2013 but also for pickpockets. When Simon Gordon took over the family business in the early 2000s, he would spend hours scrutinising the faces of the people who haunted his CCTV footage. \u201cThere was one guy who I almost felt I knew,\u201d he says. \u201cHe used to come down here the whole time and steal.\u201d The man vanished for a six-month stretch, but then reappeared, chubbier, apparently after a stint in jail. When two of Gordon\u2019s friends visited the bar for lunch and both had their wallets pinched in his presence, he decided to take matters into his own hands. \u201cThe police did nothing about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really annoyed me.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon is in his early 60s, with sandy hair and a glowing tan that hints at regular visits to Italian vineyards. He makes an unlikely tech entrepreneur, but his frustration spurred him to launch <a href=\"https://www.facewatch.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Facewatch</a>, a fast-track crime-reporting platform that allows clients (shops, hotels, casinos) to upload an incident report and CCTV clips to the police. Two years ago, when facial recognition technology was becoming widely available, the business pivoted from simply reporting into active crime deterrence. Nick Fisher, a former retail executive, was appointed Facewatch CEO; Gordon is its chairman.</p> <p>Gordon installed a \u00a33,000 camera system at the entrance to the bar and, using off-the-shelf software to carry out facial recognition analysis, began collating a private watchlist of people he had observed stealing, being aggressive or causing damage. Almost overnight, the pickpockets vanished, possibly put off by a warning at the entrance that the cameras are in use.</p> <p>The company has since rolled out the service to at least 15 \u201chousehold name retailers\u201d, which can upload photographs of people suspected of shoplifting, or other crimes, to a centralised rogues\u2019 gallery in the cloud. Facewatch provides subscribers with a high-resolution camera that can be mounted at the entrance to their premises, capturing the faces of everyone who walks in. These images are sent to a computer, which extracts biometric information and compares it to faces in the database. If there\u2019s a close match, the shop or bar manager receives a ping on their mobile phone, allowing them to monitor the target or ask them to leave; otherwise, the biometric data is discarded. It\u2019s a process that takes seconds.</p> <p>Facewatch HQ is around the corner from Gordon\u2019s, brightly lit and furnished like a tech company. Fisher invites me to approach a fisheye CCTV camera mounted at face height on the office wall; he reassures me that I won\u2019t be entered on to the watchlist. The camera captures a thumbnail photo of my face, which is beamed to an \u201cedge box\u201d (a sophisticated computer) and converted into a string of numbers. My biometric data is then compared with that of the faces on the watchlist. I am not a match: \u201cIt has no history of you,\u201d Fisher explains. However, when he walks in front of the camera, his phone pings almost instantly, as his face is matched to a seven-year-old photo that he has saved in a test watchlist.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not a subject of interest, we don\u2019t store any images,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cThe argument that you walk in front of a facial recognition camera, and it gets stored and you get tracked is just.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt depends who\u2019s using it.\u201d</p> <p>While researching theft prevention, Fisher consulted a career criminal from Leeds who told him that, for people in his line of work, \u201cthe holy grail is, don\u2019t get recognised\u201d. This, he says, makes Facewatch the ultimate deterrent. He tells me he has signed a deal with a major UK supermarket chain (he won\u2019t reveal which) and is set to roll out the system across their stores this autumn. On a conservative estimate, Fisher says, Facewatch will have 5,000 cameras across the UK by 2022.</p> <p>The company also has a contract with the Brazilian police, who have used the platform in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cWe caught the number two on Interpol\u2019s most-wanted South America list, a drug baron,\u201d says Fisher, who adds the system also led to the capture of a male murderer who had been on the run for several years, spotted dressed as a woman at the Rio carnival. I ask him whether people are right to be concerned about the potential of facial recognition to erode personal privacy. \u201cMy view is that, if you\u2019ve got something to be worried about, you should probably be worried,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s used proportionately and responsibly, it\u2019s probably one of the safest technologies today.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, not everyone sees things this way. In the past year, as the use of facial recognition technology by police and private companies has increased, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facial-recognition\" title=\"\">the debate has intensified over the threat it could pose</a> to personal privacy and marginalised groups.</p> <p>The cameras have been tested by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/05/met-police-facial-recognition-software-notting-hill-carnival\" title=\"\">Metropolitan </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/05/met-police-facial-recognition-software-notting-hill-carnival\" title=\"\">police at </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/05/met-police-facial-recognition-software-notting-hill-carnival\" title=\"\">Notting Hill </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/05/met-police-facial-recognition-software-notting-hill-carnival\" title=\"\">carnival</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/12/metropolitan-police-to-use-facial-recognition-technology-remembrance-sunday-cenotaph\" title=\"\">a Remembrance Sunday commemoration</a>, and at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/03/police-face-calls-to-end-use-of-facial-recognition-software\" title=\"\">Westfield shopping centre</a> in Stratford, east London.

He had noticed facial recognition cameras in use while Christmas shopping in Cardiff city centre in 2018. Bridges was troubled by the intrusion. \u201cIt was only when I got close enough to the van to read the words \u2018facial recognition technology\u2019 that I realised what it was, by which time I would\u2019ve already had my data captured and processed,\u201d he says. When he noticed the cameras again a few months later, at a peaceful protest in Cardiff against the arms trade, he was even more concerned: it felt like an infringement of privacy, designed to deter people from protesting. South Wales police have been using the technology since 2017, often at major sporting and music events, to spot people suspected of crimes, and other \u201cpersons of interest\u201d. Their most recent deployment, in September, was at the <a href=\"http://www.elvies.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Elvis Festival in Porthcawl</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t wake up one morning and think, \u2018I want to take my local police to court\u2019,\u201d Bridges says. \u201cThe objection I had was over the way they were using the technology. The police in this country police by consent.

Unlike DNA and fingerprints, this data can also be acquired without a person\u2019s knowledge or consent.</p> <p>\u201cI think there are really big legal questions,\u201d says Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch. \u201cThe notion of doing biometric identity checks on millions of people to identify a handful of suspects is completely unprecedented. There is no legal basis to do that. It takes us hurtling down the road towards a much more expansive surveillance state.\u201d</p> <p>Some countries have embraced the potential of facial recognition. In China, which has about 200m surveillance cameras, it has become a major element of the Xue Liang (Sharp Eyes) programme, which ranks the trustworthiness of citizens and penalises or credits them accordingly. Cameras and checkpoints have been rolled out most intensively in the north-western Xinjiang province, where the Uighur people, a Muslim and minority ethnic group, account for nearly half the population. Face scanners at the entrances of shopping malls, mosques and at traffic crossings allow the government to cross-reference with photos on ID cards to track and control the movement of citizens and their access to phone and bank services.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, San Francisco became the first major US city to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/14/san-francisco-facial-recognition-police-ban\" title=\"\">ban police and other agencies from using the technology</a> in May this year, with supervisor Aaron Peskin saying: \u201cWe can have good policing without being a police state.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UK government has faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/27/watchdog-criticises-chaotic-police-use-of-facial-recognition\" title=\"\">harsh criticism from its own biometrics commissioner</a>, Prof Paul Wiles, who said the technology is being rolled out in a \u201cchaotic\u201d fashion in the absence of any clear laws. Brexit has dominated the political agenda for the past three years; while politicians have looked the other way, more and more cameras are being allowed to look at us.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Facial recognition is not a new crime-fighting tool. In 1998, a system called FaceIt, comprising a handful of CCTV cameras linked to a computer, was rolled out to great fanfare by police in the east London borough of Newham. At one stage, it was credited with a 40% drop in crime. But these early systems only worked reliably in the lab. In 2002, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/13/ukcrime.jamesmeek\" title=\"\">Guardian reporter tried in vain</a> to get spotted by FaceIt after police agreed to add him to their watchlist. He compared the system to a fake burglar alarm on the front of a house: it cuts crime because people <em>believe</em> it works, not because it does.</p> <p>However, in the past three years, the performance of facial recognition has stepped up dramatically. Independent tests by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist) found the failure rate for finding a target picture in a database of 12m faces had dropped from 5% in 2010 to 0.1% this year.</p> <p>The rapid acceleration is thanks, in part, to the goldmine of face images that have been uploaded to Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and captioned news articles in the past decade. At one time, scientists would create bespoke databases by laboriously photographing hundreds of volunteers at different angles, in different lighting conditions. By 2016, Microsoft had published a dataset, <a href=\"https://megapixels.cc/datasets/msceleb/\" title=\"\">MS Celeb</a>, with 10m face images of 100,000 people harvested from search engines \u2013 they included celebrities, broadcasters, business people and anyone with multiple tagged pictures that had been uploaded under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/\" title=\"\">Creative Commons</a> licence, allowing them to be used for research. The dataset was quietly deleted in June, after it emerged that it may have aided the development of software used by the Chinese state to control its Uighur population.</p> <p>In parallel, hardware companies have developed a new generation of powerful processing chips, called Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), uniquely adapted to crunch through a colossal number of calculations every second. The combination of big data and GPUs paved the way for an entirely new approach to facial recognition, called deep learning, which is powering a wider AI revolution.</p> <p>\u201cThe performance is just incredible,\u201d says <a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/maja-pantic-3922952b\" title=\"\">Maja Pantic</a>, research director at Samsung AI Centre, Cambridge, and a pioneer in computer vision. \u201cDeep [learning] solved some of the long-standing problems in object recognition, including face recognition.\u201d</p> <p>Recognising faces is something like a game of snap \u2013 only with millions of cards in play rather than the standard deck of 52. As a human, that skill feels intuitive, but it turns out that our brains perform this task in a surprisingly abstract and mathematical way, which computers are only now learning to emulate. The crux of the problem is this: if you\u2019re only allowed to make a limited number of measurements of a face \u2013 100, say \u2013 what do you choose to measure? Which facial landmarks differ most between people, and therefore give you the best shot at distinguishing faces?</p> <p>A deep-learning program (sometimes referred to more ominously as an \u201cagent\u201d) solves this problem through trial and error. The first step is to give it a training data set, comprising pairs of faces that it tries to match. The program starts out by making random measurements (for example, the distance from ear to ear); its guesses will initially be little better than chance. But at each attempt, it gets feedback on whether it was right or wrong, meaning that over millions of iterations it figures out which facial measurements are the most useful. Once a program has worked out how to distil faces into a string of numbers, the algorithm is packaged up as software that can be sent out into the world, to look at faces it has never seen before.</p> <p>The performance of facial recognition software varies significantly, but the most effective algorithms available, such as Microsoft\u2019s, or NEC\u2019s NeoFace, very rarely fail to match faces using a high-quality photograph. There is far less information, though, about the performance of these algorithms using images from CCTV cameras, which don\u2019t always give a clear view.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People don\u2019t understand how the technology works, and start spreading fear for no reason</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Recent trials reveal some of technology\u2019s real-world shortcomings. When South Wales police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/29/what-is-facial-recognition-and-how-sinister-is-it\" title=\"\">tried out their NeoFace system</a> for 55 hours, 2,900 potential matches were flagged, of which 2,755 were false positives and just 18 led to arrests (the number charged was not disclosed). One woman on the watchlist was \u201cspotted\u201d 10 times \u2013 none of the sightings turned out to be of her. This led to claims that the software is woefully inaccurate; in fact, police had set the threshold for a match at 60%, meaning that faces do not have to be rated as that similar to be flagged up. This minimises the chance of a person of interest slipping through the net, but also makes a lot of false positives inevitable.</p> <p>In general, Pantic says, the public overestimates the capabilities of facial recognition. In the absence of concrete details about the purpose of the surveillance in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross this summer, newspapers speculated that the cameras could be tracking shoppers and storing their biometric data. Pantic dismisses this suggestion as \u201cridiculous\u201d. Her own team has developed, as far as she is aware, the world\u2019s leading algorithm for learning new faces, and it can only store the information from about 50 faces before it slows down and stops working. \u201cIt\u2019s huge work,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how the technology works, and start spreading fear for no reason.\u201d</p> <p>This week, the Met police revealed that seven images of suspects and missing people had been supplied to the King\u2019s Cross estate \u201cto assist in the prevention of crime\u201d, after earlier denying any involvement. Writing to the London Assembly, the deputy London mayor, Sophie Linden, said she \u201cwanted to pass on the [Metropolitan police service\u2019s] apology\u201d for failing to previously disclose that the scheme existed, and announced that similar local image-sharing agreements were now banned. The police did not disclose whether any related arrests took place.</p> <p>Like many of those working at the sharp end of AI, Pantic believes the controversy is \u201csuper overblown\u201d. After all, she suggests, how seriously can we take people\u2019s concerns when they willingly upload millions of pictures to Facebook and allow their mobile phone to track their location? \u201cThe real problem is the phones,\u201d she says \u2013 a surprising statement from the head of Samsung\u2019s AI lab. \u201cYou are constantly pushed to have location services on. [Tech companies] know where you are, who you are with, what you ate, what you spent, wherever you are on the Earth.\u201d</p> <p>Concerns have been raised that facial recognition has a diversity problem, after <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212\" title=\"\">widely cited research</a> by MIT and Stanford University found that software supplied by three companies misassigned gender in 21% to 35% of cases for darker-skinned women, compared with just 1% for light-skinned men. However, based on the top 20 algorithms, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt-ongoing\" title=\"\">Nist found that</a> there is an average difference of just 0.3% in accuracy between performance for men, women, light- and dark-skinned faces. Even so, says Carlo of Big Brother Watch, the technology\u2019s impact could still be discriminatory because of where it is deployed and whose biometric data ends up on databases. It\u2019s troubling, she says, that for two years, Notting Hill carnival, the country\u2019s largest celebration of Caribbean and black British culture, was seen as an \u201cacceptable testing ground\u201d for the technology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e2272d7fa267d64ab83c7018c86bd3d82267a4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e2272d7fa267d64ab83c7018c86bd3d82267a4b/0_1018_2690_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maja Pantic, research director of Samsung Al Research Centre, photographed at Imperial College, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The real problem is phones\u2019: Maja Pantic, research director at Samsung\u2019s AI Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask Fisher about the risk of racial profiling: the charge that some groups may be more likely to fall under suspicion, say, when a shop owner is faced with ambiguous security footage. He dismisses the concern. Facewatch clients are required to record the justification for their decision to upload a picture on to the watchlist and, in a worst-case scenario, he argues, a blameless individual might be approached by a shopkeeper, not thrown into jail. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about human prejudices, you can\u2019t blame the technology for that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After our interview, I email several times to ask for a demographic breakdown of the people on the watchlist, which Fisher had offered to provide; Facewatch declines.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Bhuwan Ribhu grew up in Delhi, in a small apartment with his parents, his sister Asmita, and many children who had been rescued from slavery and exploitation. Like Gordon, Ribhu followed his parents into the family business \u2013 in his case, tracking down India\u2019s missing children, who have been enticed, forcibly taken or sold by their parents to traffickers, and end up working in illegal factories, quarries, farms and brothels. His father is the Nobel Peace laureate <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2014/satyarthi/facts/\" title=\"\">Kailash Satyarthi</a>, who founded the campaign <a href=\"https://www.bba.org.in/\" title=\"\">Bachpan Bachao Andolan</a> (Save Childhood Movement) in 1980, after realising that he could not accommodate all of the children being rescued in the family home.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge is almost incomprehensible: 63,407 child kidnappings were reported to Indian police in 2016, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Many children later resurface, but the sheer numbers involved mean it can take months or years to reunite them with their families. \u201cAbout 300,000 children have gone missing over the last five or six years, and 100,000 children are housed in various childcare institutions,\u201d says Ribhu. \u201cFor many of those, there is a parent out there looking for their child. But it is impossible to manually go through them all.\u201d</p> <p>He describes the case of Sonu, a boy from India\u2019s rural Bihar region, 1,000km from Delhi. When Sonu was 13, his parents entrusted him to a factory owner who promised him a better life and money. But they quickly lost track of their son\u2019s whereabouts and began to fear for his safety. Eventually they contacted Bachpan Bachao Andolan for help. Sonu was tracked down after about two years, hundreds of miles from home. \u201cWe found the child after sending out his photo to about 1,700 childcare institutions across India,\u201d Ribhu says. \u201cOne of them called us back and said they might have the child. People went and physically verified it. We were looking for one child in a country of 1.3 billion.\u201d</p> <p>Ribhu had read a newspaper article about the use of facial recognition to identify terrorists at airports and realised it could help. India has created two centralised databases in recent years: one containing photos of missing children, and the other containing photos of children housed in childcare institutions. In April last year, a trial was launched to see whether facial recognition software could be used to match the identities of missing and found children in the Delhi region. The trial was quickly hailed a success, with international news reports suggesting that \u201cnearly 3,000 children\u201d had been identified within four days. This was an exaggeration: the 3,000 figure refers to <em>potential </em>matches flagged by the software, not verified identifications, and it proves difficult to find out how many children have been returned to parents. (The Ministry of Women and Child Development did not respond to questions.) But Ribhu says that, since being rolled out nationally in April, there have been 10,561 possible matches and the charity has \u201cunofficial knowledge\u201d of more than 800 of these having been verified. \u201cIt has already started making a difference,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the parents whose child has been returned because of these efforts, for the parents whose child has not gone missing because the traffickers are in jail. We are using all the technological solutions available.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>China has created digital prisons with this technology: you can\u2019t use your credit card, your phone. But we are not China</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Watching footage of Sonu being reunited with his parents in a recent documentary, The Price Of Free, it is hard to argue against the deployment of a technology that could have ended his ordeal more quickly. Nonetheless, some privacy activists say such successes are used to distract from a more open-ended surveillance agenda. In July, India\u2019s Home Ministry put out a tender for a new Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) to help use real-time CCTV footage to identify missing children \u2013 but also criminals and others, by comparing the footage with a \u201cwatchlist\u201d curated from police databases or other sources.</p> <p>Real-time facial recognition, if combined with the world\u2019s largest biometric database (known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/indian-court-upholds-legality-of-worlds-largest-biometric-database\" title=\"\">Aadhaar</a>), could create the \u201cperfect Orwellian state\u201d, according to Vidushi Marda, a legal researcher at the human rights campaign group <a href=\"https://www.article19.org/\" title=\"\">Article 19</a>. About 90% of the Indian population are enrolled in Aadhaar, which allocates people a 12-digit ID number to access government services, and requires the submission of a photograph, fingerprints and iris scans. Police do not currently have access to Aadhaar records, but some fear that this could change.</p> <p>\u201cIf you say we\u2019re finding missing children with a technology, it\u2019s very difficult for anyone to say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019,\u201d Marda says. \u201cBut I think just rolling it out now is more dangerous than good.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Debates about civil liberties are often dictated by instinct: ultimately, how much do you trust law enforcement and private companies to do the right thing? When searching for common ground, I notice that both sides frequently reference China as an undesirable endpoint. Fisher thinks that the recent disquiet about facial recognition stems from the paranoia people feel after reading about its deployment there. \u201cThey\u2019ve created digital prisons using facial recognition technology. You can\u2019t use your credit card, you can\u2019t get a taxi, you can\u2019t get a bus, your mobile phone stops working,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s China. We\u2019re not China.\u201d</p> <p>Groups such as Liberty and Big Brother Watch say the opposite: since facial recognition, by definition, requires every face in a crowd to be scanned to identify a single suspect, it will turn any country that adopts it into a police state. \u201cChina has made a strategic choice that these technologies will absolutely intrude on people\u2019s liberty,\u201d says biometrics commissioner Paul Wiles. \u201cThe decisions we make will decide the future of our social and political world.\u201d</p> <p>For now, it seems that the question of whether facial recognition will make us safer, or represents a new kind of unsafe, is being left largely to chance. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave [this question] to people who want to use the technology,\u201d Wiles says. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be the owners of the space around King\u2019s Cross, it shouldn\u2019t be Facewatch, it shouldn\u2019t be the police or ministers alone \u2013 it should be parliament.\u201d</p> <p>After leaving the Facewatch office, I walk along the terrace of Gordon\u2019s, where a couple of lunchtime customers are enjoying a bottle of red in the sunshine, and past the fisheye lens at the entrance to the bar, which I now know is beaming my face to the computer cloud. I think back to a winky promise I\u2019ve read on the Gordon\u2019s website: \u201cMake your way to the cellar to your rickety candlelit table \u2013 anonymity is guaranteed!\u201d</p> <p>Out in the wider world, anonymity is no longer guaranteed. Facial recognition gives police and companies the means of identifying and tracking people of interest, while others are free to go about their business. The real question is: who gets that privilege?</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gordon\u2019s wine bar is reached through a discreet side-door, a few paces from the slipstream of London theatregoers and suited professionals powering towards their evening train. A steep staircase plunges visitors into a dimly lit cavern, lined with dusty champagne bottles and faded newspaper clippings, which appears to have had only minor refurbishment since it opened in 1890. \u201cIf Miss Havisham was in the licensing trade,\u201d an Evening Standard review once suggested, \u201cthis could have been the result.\u201d The bar\u2019s Dickensian gloom is a selling point for people embarking on affairs, and actors or politicians wanting a quiet drink \u2013 but also for pickpockets. When Simon Gordon took over the family business in the early 2000s, he would spend hours scrutinising the faces of the people who haunted his CCTV footage. \u201cThere was one guy who I almost felt I knew,\u201d he says. \u201cHe used to come down here the whole time and steal.\u201d The man vanished for a six-month stretch, but then reappeared, chubbier, apparently after a stint in jail. When two of Gordon\u2019s friends visited the bar for lunch and both had their wallets pinched in his presence, he decided to take matters into his own hands. \u201cThe police did nothing about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really annoyed me.\u201d Gordon is in his early 60s, with sandy hair and a glowing tan that hints at regular visits to Italian vineyards. He makes an unlikely tech entrepreneur, but his frustration spurred him to launch Facewatch, a fast-track crime-reporting platform that allows clients (shops, hotels, casinos) to upload an incident report and CCTV clips to the police. Two years ago, when facial recognition technology was becoming widely available, the business pivoted from simply reporting into active crime deterrence. Nick Fisher, a former retail executive, was appointed Facewatch CEO; Gordon is its chairman. Gordon installed a \u00a33,000 camera system at the entrance to the bar and, using off-the-shelf software to carry out facial recognition analysis, began collating a private watchlist of people he had observed stealing, being aggressive or causing damage. Almost overnight, the pickpockets vanished, possibly put off by a warning at the entrance that the cameras are in use. The company has since rolled out the service to at least 15 \u201chousehold name retailers\u201d, which can upload photographs of people suspected of shoplifting, or other crimes, to a centralised rogues\u2019 gallery in the cloud. Facewatch provides subscribers with a high-resolution camera that can be mounted at the entrance to their premises, capturing the faces of everyone who walks in. These images are sent to a computer, which extracts biometric information and compares it to faces in the database. If there\u2019s a close match, the shop or bar manager receives a ping on their mobile phone, allowing them to monitor the target or ask them to leave; otherwise, the biometric data is discarded. It\u2019s a process that takes seconds. Facewatch HQ is around the corner from Gordon\u2019s, brightly lit and furnished like a tech company. Fisher invites me to approach a fisheye CCTV camera mounted at face height on the office wall; he reassures me that I won\u2019t be entered on to the watchlist. The camera captures a thumbnail photo of my face, which is beamed to an \u201cedge box\u201d (a sophisticated computer) and converted into a string of numbers. My biometric data is then compared with that of the faces on the watchlist. I am not a match: \u201cIt has no history of you,\u201d Fisher explains. However, when he walks in front of the camera, his phone pings almost instantly, as his face is matched to a seven-year-old photo that he has saved in a test watchlist. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a subject of interest, we don\u2019t store any images,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cThe argument that you walk in front of a facial recognition camera, and it gets stored and you get tracked is just.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt depends who\u2019s using it.\u201d While researching theft prevention, Fisher consulted a career criminal from Leeds who told him that, for people in his line of work, \u201cthe holy grail is, don\u2019t get recognised\u201d. This, he says, makes Facewatch the ultimate deterrent. He tells me he has signed a deal with a major UK supermarket chain (he won\u2019t reveal which) and is set to roll out the system across their stores this autumn. On a conservative estimate, Fisher says, Facewatch will have 5,000 cameras across the UK by 2022. The company also has a contract with the Brazilian police, who have used the platform in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cWe caught the number two on Interpol\u2019s most-wanted South America list, a drug baron,\u201d says Fisher, who adds the system also led to the capture of a male murderer who had been on the run for several years, spotted dressed as a woman at the Rio carnival. I ask him whether people are right to be concerned about the potential of facial recognition to erode personal privacy. \u201cMy view is that, if you\u2019ve got something to be worried about, you should probably be worried,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s used proportionately and responsibly, it\u2019s probably one of the safest technologies today.\u201d *** Unsurprisingly, not everyone sees things this way. In the past year, as the use of facial recognition technology by police and private companies has increased, the debate has intensified over the threat it could pose to personal privacy and marginalised groups. The cameras have been tested by the Metropolitan police at Notting Hill carnival, a Remembrance Sunday commemoration, and at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London. This summer, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, wrote to the owners of a private development in King\u2019s Cross, demanding more information after it emerged that facial recognition had been deployed there for unknown purposes. In May, Ed Bridges, a public affairs manager at Cardiff University, launched a landmark legal case against South Wales police. He had noticed facial recognition cameras in use while Christmas shopping in Cardiff city centre in 2018. Bridges was troubled by the intrusion. \u201cIt was only when I got close enough to the van to read the words \u2018facial recognition technology\u2019 that I realised what it was, by which time I would\u2019ve already had my data captured and processed,\u201d he says. When he noticed the cameras again a few months later, at a peaceful protest in Cardiff against the arms trade, he was even more concerned: it felt like an infringement of privacy, designed to deter people from protesting. South Wales police have been using the technology since 2017, often at major sporting and music events, to spot people suspected of crimes, and other \u201cpersons of interest\u201d. Their most recent deployment, in September, was at the Elvis Festival in Porthcawl. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake up one morning and think, \u2018I want to take my local police to court\u2019,\u201d Bridges says. \u201cThe objection I had was over the way they were using the technology. The police in this country police by consent. This undermines trust in them.\u201d During a three-day hearing, lawyers for Bridge, supported by the human rights group Liberty, alleged the surveillance operation breached data protection and equality laws. But last month, Cardiff\u2019s high court ruled that the trial, backed by \u00a32m from the Home Office, had been lawful. Bridges is appealing, but South Wales police are pushing forward with a new trial of a facial recognition app on officers\u2019 mobile phones. The force says it will enable officers to confirm the identity of a suspect \u201calmost instantaneously, even if that suspect provides false or misleading details, thus securing their quick arrest\u201d. The Metropolitan police have also been the subject of a judicial review by the privacy group Big Brother Watch and the Green peer Jenny Jones, who discovered that her own picture was held on a police database of \u201cdomestic extremists\u201d. In contrast with DNA and fingerprint data, which normally have to be destroyed within a certain time period if individuals are arrested or charged but not convicted, there are no specific rules in the UK on the retention of facial images. The Police National Database has snowballed to contain about 20m faces, of which a large proportion have never been charged or convicted of an offence. Unlike DNA and fingerprints, this data can also be acquired without a person\u2019s knowledge or consent. \u201cI think there are really big legal questions,\u201d says Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch. \u201cThe notion of doing biometric identity checks on millions of people to identify a handful of suspects is completely unprecedented. There is no legal basis to do that. It takes us hurtling down the road towards a much more expansive surveillance state.\u201d Some countries have embraced the potential of facial recognition. In China, which has about 200m surveillance cameras, it has become a major element of the Xue Liang (Sharp Eyes) programme, which ranks the trustworthiness of citizens and penalises or credits them accordingly. Cameras and checkpoints have been rolled out most intensively in the north-western Xinjiang province, where the Uighur people, a Muslim and minority ethnic group, account for nearly half the population. Face scanners at the entrances of shopping malls, mosques and at traffic crossings allow the government to cross-reference with photos on ID cards to track and control the movement of citizens and their access to phone and bank services. At the other end of the spectrum, San Francisco became the first major US city to ban police and other agencies from using the technology in May this year, with supervisor Aaron Peskin saying: \u201cWe can have good policing without being a police state.\u201d Meanwhile, the UK government has faced harsh criticism from its own biometrics commissioner, Prof Paul Wiles, who said the technology is being rolled out in a \u201cchaotic\u201d fashion in the absence of any clear laws. Brexit has dominated the political agenda for the past three years; while politicians have looked the other way, more and more cameras are being allowed to look at us. *** Facial recognition is not a new crime-fighting tool. In 1998, a system called FaceIt, comprising a handful of CCTV cameras linked to a computer, was rolled out to great fanfare by police in the east London borough of Newham. At one stage, it was credited with a 40% drop in crime. But these early systems only worked reliably in the lab. In 2002, a Guardian reporter tried in vain to get spotted by FaceIt after police agreed to add him to their watchlist. He compared the system to a fake burglar alarm on the front of a house: it cuts crime because people believe it works, not because it does. However, in the past three years, the performance of facial recognition has stepped up dramatically. Independent tests by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist) found the failure rate for finding a target picture in a database of 12m faces had dropped from 5% in 2010 to 0.1% this year. The rapid acceleration is thanks, in part, to the goldmine of face images that have been uploaded to Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and captioned news articles in the past decade. At one time, scientists would create bespoke databases by laboriously photographing hundreds of volunteers at different angles, in different lighting conditions. By 2016, Microsoft had published a dataset, MS Celeb, with 10m face images of 100,000 people harvested from search engines \u2013 they included celebrities, broadcasters, business people and anyone with multiple tagged pictures that had been uploaded under a Creative Commons licence, allowing them to be used for research. The dataset was quietly deleted in June, after it emerged that it may have aided the development of software used by the Chinese state to control its Uighur population. In parallel, hardware companies have developed a new generation of powerful processing chips, called Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), uniquely adapted to crunch through a colossal number of calculations every second. The combination of big data and GPUs paved the way for an entirely new approach to facial recognition, called deep learning, which is powering a wider AI revolution. \u201cThe performance is just incredible,\u201d says Maja Pantic, research director at Samsung AI Centre, Cambridge, and a pioneer in computer vision. \u201cDeep [learning] solved some of the long-standing problems in object recognition, including face recognition.\u201d Recognising faces is something like a game of snap \u2013 only with millions of cards in play rather than the standard deck of 52. As a human, that skill feels intuitive, but it turns out that our brains perform this task in a surprisingly abstract and mathematical way, which computers are only now learning to emulate. The crux of the problem is this: if you\u2019re only allowed to make a limited number of measurements of a face \u2013 100, say \u2013 what do you choose to measure? Which facial landmarks differ most between people, and therefore give you the best shot at distinguishing faces? A deep-learning program (sometimes referred to more ominously as an \u201cagent\u201d) solves this problem through trial and error. The first step is to give it a training data set, comprising pairs of faces that it tries to match. The program starts out by making random measurements (for example, the distance from ear to ear); its guesses will initially be little better than chance. But at each attempt, it gets feedback on whether it was right or wrong, meaning that over millions of iterations it figures out which facial measurements are the most useful. Once a program has worked out how to distil faces into a string of numbers, the algorithm is packaged up as software that can be sent out into the world, to look at faces it has never seen before. The performance of facial recognition software varies significantly, but the most effective algorithms available, such as Microsoft\u2019s, or NEC\u2019s NeoFace, very rarely fail to match faces using a high-quality photograph. There is far less information, though, about the performance of these algorithms using images from CCTV cameras, which don\u2019t always give a clear view. Recent trials reveal some of technology\u2019s real-world shortcomings. When South Wales police tried out their NeoFace system for 55 hours, 2,900 potential matches were flagged, of which 2,755 were false positives and just 18 led to arrests (the number charged was not disclosed). One woman on the watchlist was \u201cspotted\u201d 10 times \u2013 none of the sightings turned out to be of her. This led to claims that the software is woefully inaccurate; in fact, police had set the threshold for a match at 60%, meaning that faces do not have to be rated as that similar to be flagged up. This minimises the chance of a person of interest slipping through the net, but also makes a lot of false positives inevitable. In general, Pantic says, the public overestimates the capabilities of facial recognition. In the absence of concrete details about the purpose of the surveillance in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross this summer, newspapers speculated that the cameras could be tracking shoppers and storing their biometric data. Pantic dismisses this suggestion as \u201cridiculous\u201d. Her own team has developed, as far as she is aware, the world\u2019s leading algorithm for learning new faces, and it can only store the information from about 50 faces before it slows down and stops working. \u201cIt\u2019s huge work,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how the technology works, and start spreading fear for no reason.\u201d This week, the Met police revealed that seven images of suspects and missing people had been supplied to the King\u2019s Cross estate \u201cto assist in the prevention of crime\u201d, after earlier denying any involvement. Writing to the London Assembly, the deputy London mayor, Sophie Linden, said she \u201cwanted to pass on the [Metropolitan police service\u2019s] apology\u201d for failing to previously disclose that the scheme existed, and announced that similar local image-sharing agreements were now banned. The police did not disclose whether any related arrests took place. Like many of those working at the sharp end of AI, Pantic believes the controversy is \u201csuper overblown\u201d. After all, she suggests, how seriously can we take people\u2019s concerns when they willingly upload millions of pictures to Facebook and allow their mobile phone to track their location? \u201cThe real problem is the phones,\u201d she says \u2013 a surprising statement from the head of Samsung\u2019s AI lab. \u201cYou are constantly pushed to have location services on. [Tech companies] know where you are, who you are with, what you ate, what you spent, wherever you are on the Earth.\u201d Concerns have been raised that facial recognition has a diversity problem, after widely cited research by MIT and Stanford University found that software supplied by three companies misassigned gender in 21% to 35% of cases for darker-skinned women, compared with just 1% for light-skinned men. However, based on the top 20 algorithms, Nist found that there is an average difference of just 0.3% in accuracy between performance for men, women, light- and dark-skinned faces. Even so, says Carlo of Big Brother Watch, the technology\u2019s impact could still be discriminatory because of where it is deployed and whose biometric data ends up on databases. It\u2019s troubling, she says, that for two years, Notting Hill carnival, the country\u2019s largest celebration of Caribbean and black British culture, was seen as an \u201cacceptable testing ground\u201d for the technology. I ask Fisher about the risk of racial profiling: the charge that some groups may be more likely to fall under suspicion, say, when a shop owner is faced with ambiguous security footage. He dismisses the concern. Facewatch clients are required to record the justification for their decision to upload a picture on to the watchlist and, in a worst-case scenario, he argues, a blameless individual might be approached by a shopkeeper, not thrown into jail. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about human prejudices, you can\u2019t blame the technology for that,\u201d he says. After our interview, I email several times to ask for a demographic breakdown of the people on the watchlist, which Fisher had offered to provide; Facewatch declines. *** Bhuwan Ribhu grew up in Delhi, in a small apartment with his parents, his sister Asmita, and many children who had been rescued from slavery and exploitation. Like Gordon, Ribhu followed his parents into the family business \u2013 in his case, tracking down India\u2019s missing children, who have been enticed, forcibly taken or sold by their parents to traffickers, and end up working in illegal factories, quarries, farms and brothels. His father is the Nobel Peace laureate Kailash Satyarthi, who founded the campaign Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save Childhood Movement) in 1980, after realising that he could not accommodate all of the children being rescued in the family home. The scale of the challenge is almost incomprehensible: 63,407 child kidnappings were reported to Indian police in 2016, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Many children later resurface, but the sheer numbers involved mean it can take months or years to reunite them with their families. \u201cAbout 300,000 children have gone missing over the last five or six years, and 100,000 children are housed in various childcare institutions,\u201d says Ribhu. \u201cFor many of those, there is a parent out there looking for their child. But it is impossible to manually go through them all.\u201d He describes the case of Sonu, a boy from India\u2019s rural Bihar region, 1,000km from Delhi. When Sonu was 13, his parents entrusted him to a factory owner who promised him a better life and money. But they quickly lost track of their son\u2019s whereabouts and began to fear for his safety. Eventually they contacted Bachpan Bachao Andolan for help. Sonu was tracked down after about two years, hundreds of miles from home. \u201cWe found the child after sending out his photo to about 1,700 childcare institutions across India,\u201d Ribhu says. \u201cOne of them called us back and said they might have the child. People went and physically verified it. We were looking for one child in a country of 1.3 billion.\u201d Ribhu had read a newspaper article about the use of facial recognition to identify terrorists at airports and realised it could help. India has created two centralised databases in recent years: one containing photos of missing children, and the other containing photos of children housed in childcare institutions. In April last year, a trial was launched to see whether facial recognition software could be used to match the identities of missing and found children in the Delhi region. The trial was quickly hailed a success, with international news reports suggesting that \u201cnearly 3,000 children\u201d had been identified within four days. This was an exaggeration: the 3,000 figure refers to potential matches flagged by the software, not verified identifications, and it proves difficult to find out how many children have been returned to parents. (The Ministry of Women and Child Development did not respond to questions.) But Ribhu says that, since being rolled out nationally in April, there have been 10,561 possible matches and the charity has \u201cunofficial knowledge\u201d of more than 800 of these having been verified. \u201cIt has already started making a difference,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the parents whose child has been returned because of these efforts, for the parents whose child has not gone missing because the traffickers are in jail. We are using all the technological solutions available.\u201d Watching footage of Sonu being reunited with his parents in a recent documentary, The Price Of Free, it is hard to argue against the deployment of a technology that could have ended his ordeal more quickly. Nonetheless, some privacy activists say such successes are used to distract from a more open-ended surveillance agenda. In July, India\u2019s Home Ministry put out a tender for a new Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) to help use real-time CCTV footage to identify missing children \u2013 but also criminals and others, by comparing the footage with a \u201cwatchlist\u201d curated from police databases or other sources. Real-time facial recognition, if combined with the world\u2019s largest biometric database (known as Aadhaar), could create the \u201cperfect Orwellian state\u201d, according to Vidushi Marda, a legal researcher at the human rights campaign group Article 19. About 90% of the Indian population are enrolled in Aadhaar, which allocates people a 12-digit ID number to access government services, and requires the submission of a photograph, fingerprints and iris scans. Police do not currently have access to Aadhaar records, but some fear that this could change. \u201cIf you say we\u2019re finding missing children with a technology, it\u2019s very difficult for anyone to say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019,\u201d Marda says. \u201cBut I think just rolling it out now is more dangerous than good.\u201d *** Debates about civil liberties are often dictated by instinct: ultimately, how much do you trust law enforcement and private companies to do the right thing? When searching for common ground, I notice that both sides frequently reference China as an undesirable endpoint. Fisher thinks that the recent disquiet about facial recognition stems from the paranoia people feel after reading about its deployment there. \u201cThey\u2019ve created digital prisons using facial recognition technology. You can\u2019t use your credit card, you can\u2019t get a taxi, you can\u2019t get a bus, your mobile phone stops working,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s China. We\u2019re not China.\u201d Groups such as Liberty and Big Brother Watch say the opposite: since facial recognition, by definition, requires every face in a crowd to be scanned to identify a single suspect, it will turn any country that adopts it into a police state. \u201cChina has made a strategic choice that these technologies will absolutely intrude on people\u2019s liberty,\u201d says biometrics commissioner Paul Wiles. \u201cThe decisions we make will decide the future of our social and political world.\u201d For now, it seems that the question of whether facial recognition will make us safer, or represents a new kind of unsafe, is being left largely to chance. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave [this question] to people who want to use the technology,\u201d Wiles says. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be the owners of the space around King\u2019s Cross, it shouldn\u2019t be Facewatch, it shouldn\u2019t be the police or ministers alone \u2013 it should be parliament.\u201d After leaving the Facewatch office, I walk along the terrace of Gordon\u2019s, where a couple of lunchtime customers are enjoying a bottle of red in the sunshine, and past the fisheye lens at the entrance to the bar, which I now know is beaming my face to the computer cloud. I think back to a winky promise I\u2019ve read on the Gordon\u2019s website: \u201cMake your way to the cellar to your rickety candlelit table \u2013 anonymity is guaranteed!\u201d Out in the wider world, anonymity is no longer guaranteed. Facial recognition gives police and companies the means of identifying and tracking people of interest, while others are free to go about their business. The real question is: who gets that privilege? \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>I grew up going on family holidays to the Lake District. It feels now as it did then: an inspirational place for adventure, a place of Swallows and Amazons with easy access to the water and the promise of the encircling craggy fell-tops. The immediate draw for our family is the exciting outdoor activities. Despite being the most visited of the UK\u2019s national parks, the Lake District is always big enough and wild enough that we can find our own cherished niches in the landscape, where the children can run free and discover a vast natural playground for themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"834e1b2adf3791e264e11f8d44dd0a7b6480a114\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/834e1b2adf3791e264e11f8d44dd0a7b6480a114/0_4_940_646/500.jpg\" alt=\"lake district map\" width=\"500\" height=\"344\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For years, we have based ourselves in the Keswick area of the northern Lakes, where there are thrills for families of all ages and the mountain scenery is more rugged than in the busier southern areas.</p> <p>Autumn is a great time to go out exploring on the water \u2013 although the air temperature has cooled, seasonal lag means the water is still relatively warm. Jump in a canoe or kayak at Keswick and the teardrop-shaped Derwentwater, with its steep-sided guardian fells, is there to discover. With our young captains (aged five and eight) taking the helm, we steered a course to St Herbert\u2019s Island, home in the seventh century to the reclusive saint, whose meagre cell can be found in the wooded undergrowth. It is a favourite for tree-climbing, swimming and generally running amok, pretending to be pirates. Scenes from the 2016 film adaptation of Swallows and Amazons were shot here \u2013 and our children got into character by hurling \u201cscurvy dog\u201d and \u201cson of a sea snake\u201d insults at each other. </p> <p>Climbing to the ridged top of Catbells is something of a rite of passage for youngsters in these parts. The classic approach is by the launch boat from Keswick to Hawes End and up the distinctive curving spine, looking down on Derwentwater. The simple scrambling section of the ascent \u2013 which has been cheekily dubbed \u201cthe granny-stopper\u201d \u2013 is perfect for families; for bigger challenges, the nearby Buttermere Fells are unrelentingly steep, rocky and exhilarating, whereas the Borrowdale Fells are lower but a little tougher and wilder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f3c713dcde6bd47ac16fc8f9f9368f9d5940464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f3c713dcde6bd47ac16fc8f9f9368f9d5940464/0_53_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Families walking up Catbells on sunny day with view overlooking Derwent Water\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families walking up Catbells, with Derwentwater in the distance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We introduced our young family to backpacking at the remote 22-bed Skiddaw House youth hostel. Only accessible on foot or mountain bike, this remote bunkhouse is the highest hostel in Britain, standing in proud isolation on the eastern slopes of its namesake mountain. The 3\u00bd-mile uphill hike passes the impressive Whitewater Dash waterfalls and slopes laden with bilberries \u2013 distractions which almost made our children forget they were carrying rucksacks packed with all they\u2019d need for a two-night stay. The house itself is delightfully spooky, as well as eco-friendly and pretty much off-grid \u2013 flickering solar lighting, stoves fuelled by coppiced wood, spring-fed water and gas-fired showers. There are no plug sockets, no mobile signal and no wifi \u2013 but there is a well-stocked bar, homemade cake, battered guitars and board games.</p> <p>The hostel is a launchpad for tackling the lofty tops of Skiddaw and Blencathra \u2013 England\u2019s third and eighth highest mountains \u2013 making them impressive but realistic goals for families. Plentiful chocolate and occasional use of a sturdy back carrier got our then three-year-old to the top of Skiddaw a couple of years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caec34fc6c5b42d4f81cb2962f85b27dc3b41988\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caec34fc6c5b42d4f81cb2962f85b27dc3b41988/0_162_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skiddaw House hostel exterior with dry-stone wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skiddaw House hostel on the flanks of Skiddaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Cartwright/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few minutes\u2019 drive from Keswick is Whinlatter Forest, with its <a href=\"https://www.forestryengland.uk/whinlatter-forest/cycling-and-mountain-biking-trails-whinlatter\" title=\"\">purpose-built </a><a href=\"https://www.forestryengland.uk/whinlatter-forest/cycling-and-mountain-biking-trails-whinlatter\" title=\"\">mountain biking trails</a> that will keep children aged eight-plus literally on the edge of their seats.

It was rock climbing that drew me to the area in my 20s and now it\u2019s a big hit with our children. Even the more famous crags here have some easier routes perfect for introducing children to climbing outdoors \u2013 a very different experience from indoor walls. Outdoor climbing can involve a fair bit of waiting around, as well as the obvious bursts of adrenaline.</p> <p>Upper Shepherds Crag is family-friendly and set in a perfect picnic meadow. The slabs at Steel Knotts also make great beginners\u2019 climbing. Families with older children could even try mountaineering at Seathwaite Slabs and Sourmilk Ghyll waterfall.

      "bodyText": "I grew up going on family holidays to the Lake District. It feels now as it did then: an inspirational place for adventure, a place of Swallows and Amazons with easy access to the water and the promise of the encircling craggy fell-tops. The immediate draw for our family is the exciting outdoor activities. Despite being the most visited of the UK\u2019s national parks, the Lake District is always big enough and wild enough that we can find our own cherished niches in the landscape, where the children can run free and discover a vast natural playground for themselves. For years, we have based ourselves in the Keswick area of the northern Lakes, where there are thrills for families of all ages and the mountain scenery is more rugged than in the busier southern areas. Autumn is a great time to go out exploring on the water \u2013 although the air temperature has cooled, seasonal lag means the water is still relatively warm. Jump in a canoe or kayak at Keswick and the teardrop-shaped Derwentwater, with its steep-sided guardian fells, is there to discover. With our young captains (aged five and eight) taking the helm, we steered a course to St Herbert\u2019s Island, home in the seventh century to the reclusive saint, whose meagre cell can be found in the wooded undergrowth. It is a favourite for tree-climbing, swimming and generally running amok, pretending to be pirates. Scenes from the 2016 film adaptation of Swallows and Amazons were shot here \u2013 and our children got into character by hurling \u201cscurvy dog\u201d and \u201cson of a sea snake\u201d insults at each other. Climbing to the ridged top of Catbells is something of a rite of passage for youngsters in these parts. The classic approach is by the launch boat from Keswick to Hawes End and up the distinctive curving spine, looking down on Derwentwater. The simple scrambling section of the ascent \u2013 which has been cheekily dubbed \u201cthe granny-stopper\u201d \u2013 is perfect for families; for bigger challenges, the nearby Buttermere Fells are unrelentingly steep, rocky and exhilarating, whereas the Borrowdale Fells are lower but a little tougher and wilder. We introduced our young family to backpacking at the remote 22-bed Skiddaw House youth hostel. Only accessible on foot or mountain bike, this remote bunkhouse is the highest hostel in Britain, standing in proud isolation on the eastern slopes of its namesake mountain. The 3\u00bd-mile uphill hike passes the impressive Whitewater Dash waterfalls and slopes laden with bilberries \u2013 distractions which almost made our children forget they were carrying rucksacks packed with all they\u2019d need for a two-night stay. The house itself is delightfully spooky, as well as eco-friendly and pretty much off-grid \u2013 flickering solar lighting, stoves fuelled by coppiced wood, spring-fed water and gas-fired showers. There are no plug sockets, no mobile signal and no wifi \u2013 but there is a well-stocked bar, homemade cake, battered guitars and board games. The hostel is a launchpad for tackling the lofty tops of Skiddaw and Blencathra \u2013 England\u2019s third and eighth highest mountains \u2013 making them impressive but realistic goals for families. Plentiful chocolate and occasional use of a sturdy back carrier got our then three-year-old to the top of Skiddaw a couple of years ago. A few minutes\u2019 drive from Keswick is Whinlatter Forest, with its purpose-built mountain biking trails that will keep children aged eight-plus literally on the edge of their seats. The setting is reminiscent of Endor, home of the tree-dwelling Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, and the technical challenge of the Quercus trail\u2019s snaking duckboards, undulations and switchbacks is at just the right level for keen bikers. There\u2019s no charge other than parking, and bikes can be hired on site. For younger children there are imaginative adventure playgrounds and \u2013 as is increasingly common \u2013 there\u2019s a selection of ziplines and treetop nets to play on, too. South of Keswick is Borrowdale, a craggy valley renowned for rock climbing since the pioneering days of the sport in the 1880s. It was rock climbing that drew me to the area in my 20s and now it\u2019s a big hit with our children. Even the more famous crags here have some easier routes perfect for introducing children to climbing outdoors \u2013 a very different experience from indoor walls. Outdoor climbing can involve a fair bit of waiting around, as well as the obvious bursts of adrenaline. Upper Shepherds Crag is family-friendly and set in a perfect picnic meadow. The slabs at Steel Knotts also make great beginners\u2019 climbing. Families with older children could even try mountaineering at Seathwaite Slabs and Sourmilk Ghyll waterfall. Our family spent an enjoyable day climbing at Church Crag near the sparsely settled St John\u2019s in the Vale. The location feels disproportionately remote (though only five minutes from Keswick in the car) and a trip can be combined with a visit to the ancient Druid stone circle at Castlerigg. Keswick Climbing Wall is nearby, which offers family outdoor climbing experiences and decent indoor facilities for when inclement weather strikes. There are plenty of costly and popular \u201cadventure attractions\u201d in the Lakes, but for our family the less-frequented nooks, crannies and wild spaces have often provided the most memorable experiences. Exploring the cave in Borrowdale that was once home of the self-styled professor of adventure, Millican Dalton, is one of these. The quarried caves are best visited from the village of Grange on a trip to scale the mighty mini-mountain of Castle Crag, with its otherworldly plateau of standing slate shards and its precipitous, knobbly summit. Look out for makeshift riverside rope swings near the cave \u2013 and expect your children to wear out the seats of their trousers on the natural slide of the summit stone. Finding a place to play together in the natural landscape has been our real Lakeland adventure story. \u2022 Hire a double kayak plus gear at Keswick Water Sports or Nichol End Marine, \u00a315 an hour. Stay at Skiddaw House dorm beds from \u00a320, family rooms from \u00a380. Whinlatter bike hire, \u00a321 half day, \u00a329 full day.

      "body": "<p>Author Jacqueline Woodson recently spoke about books being either mirrors or windows. Mirrors for seeing ourselves, and windows for seeing into other worlds. Growing up, I enjoyed both types of books, from the realistic contemporary fiction of Judy Blume to the epic fantasy of JRR Tolkien. I had access to books by these and every author in between courtesy of a bookstore a short drive from my house. I didn\u2019t understand my privilege then, but I\u2019ve come to understand it better over time.</p> <p>In the short time that it was open, I developed interests that would shape my career. I grew up at the advent of personal computing, and the books I read helped me along a path to becoming a programmer. I also developed a deep appreciation for comics, thanks to an expansive humour section at the bookstore. Those comic collections helped to prepare me for my dream career as a cartoonist. Had we not had a bookstore nearby during my formative years, I would have grown up to be a completely different person.</p> <p>Our local bookstore went out of business a few years after it opened, and I\u2019ll never forget the confusion and hurt I felt when I saw the darkened windows for the first time. It was my first experience of losing something that seemed so obviously good. </p> <p>And so when I found myself in a position, many years later, to open a bookstore in my adopted hometown of Plainville, Massachusetts, I was eager to make it happen. It felt like a way of righting the wrong that I experienced as a kid, while at the same time fighting back against the creeping suffocation of a world that was changing a little too quickly. But long before we opened our doors, we needed to actually build the doors. And the walls, and the floors, and everything else that went into the construction of what we would come to call An Unlikely Story.</p> <p>My wife and I moved to Plainville 17 years ago, and it\u2019s where we\u2019ve raised our children. Most towns in Massachusetts have followed a similar trajectory: the town grows around an industry, then the industry moves on, but the people stay. People work and shop outside the town, which leads to an abandonment of the downtown and a slow, sad decay of its structures. Such was the case in Plainville. At the centre of our downtown was Falk\u2019s Market, a general store that was once the nerve centre of the community. It was operated by Merrill Falk, a beloved shopkeeper whose passing left the building shuttered and empty for 17 years. By the time my wife and I purchased the building, the centre was caved in, and there was not a scrap of wood that was salvageable. The only way to save the place was to tear it down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a93989246eb5b2f4967f0cbf322919da5564f1e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a93989246eb5b2f4967f0cbf322919da5564f1e0/0_1162_7780_4670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kinneys store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Long before we opened our doors to customers, we needed to actually build the doors\u2019 \u2026 Kinneys store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Churchill/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The steps ahead were daunting.

Hopefully as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbcLcSY2au4\">Megan Thee Stallion</a> intended when she coined the term, it was breezily unselfconscious, body positive, full of outdoor drinking sessions and fun selfies. As the 24-year-old rapper posted on Twitter back in July: \u201cBeing a Hot Girl is about being unapologetically YOU, having fun, being confident, living YOUR truth, being the life of the party etc\u201d. Now, as the nights close in, there is a sense of transition in the air. What comes next?</p> <p>It was a question posited by Jimmy Fallon last week, when the Tonight Show host duetted with the rapper for a seasonal sequel, Hot Girl Fall. The answer? \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that the weather may be getting cooler but we\u2019re just heating up,\u201d Megan explained, before listing the many ways in which you could bring the Hot Girl attitude to autumn (turtle necks, turkey, wine, new stationery, pumpkins, flu shots). Supporting this theory further was the long-awaited September drop of Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s video for the original single. Hot Girl Summer ft <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/05/nick-minaj-retires-claim-twitter-family-life\">Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/ty-dolla-ign-free-tc-review-la-rapper-debut\">Ty Dolla $ign</a> was first teased in a tweet in July, but we didn\u2019t get to see Megan and Nicki\u2019s pool-lounger twerking until 3 September, the traditional summer cut-off in the US.</p> <p>Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/07/hustlers-review-j-lo-strippers-candace-wu\">Hustlers</a> \u2013 surely Hot Girl Summer in celluloid form \u2013 didn\u2019t come out until 10 days after that. The film features cameos from ultimate hotties <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/01/how-cardi-b-went-from-stripper-to-star\">Cardi B</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/19/body-positive-rapper-lizzo-my-job-is-to-emote-and-communicate-and-bop\">Lizzo</a>, but stars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/28/jennifer-lopez-comeback-of-positively-epic-proportions\">Jennifer Lopez</a> and Constance Wu as scamming strippers, who use their wiles to keep the party going even after the markets crash in 2008; real hot girl shit, as Megan would say. Lopez \u2013 still an undeniable Hot Girl, at 50 \u2013 spends much of the movie in skimpy outfits that would fit right in at Nicki\u2019n\u2019Meg\u2019s pool party. Notably, though, when taking rooftop ciggie breaks, she covers up with a floor-length chinchilla coat, large enough to also envelop stripper newbies like Wu\u2019s character. That\u2019s one way to keep a girl hot, even after the sun goes down.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eusys1zx-KM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Eusys1zx-KM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>For some, though, the onset of cold weather will always signal the start of Cuffing Season, that period from October to March when everyone wants a significant other to snuggle with. Luckily there\u2019s a get-out clause for those guys, too: \u201cIf you are cuffed up, you can still have a hot girl summer,\u201d Megan advised in a recent red-carpet interview. With one proviso: \u201cBut you still gotta be on your bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re happy with the general Hot Girl vibe, but require a seasonally appropriate title change, then the continuity candidate is \u201cThotumn\u201d. It\u2019s a pleasing portmanteau \u2013 autumn and \u201cthot\u201d, a reclaimed slang term for a woman who likes sex \u2013 that\u2019s currently riding high on Instagram. If, however, you\u2019re the sort of person who gets grumpy about seeing fairy lights in shops in November, that won\u2019t do at all. You\u2019ll need a distinctly new mood for the new month.</p> <p>It might be simplest to start with what\u2019s definitely not coming next. Like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/christiangirlautumn/?hl=en\">Christian Girl Autumn</a>\u201d. This mini-meme was born on 10 August when a 19-year-old self-described troll from Long Island Google-image-searched the terms \u201ccute church outfits\u201d and \u201call scarf outfits\u201d. He came up with a photograph of two perfectly coiffed white women posing side-by-side during a shopping trip and posted it along with a few red leaf emojis and the caption: \u201cHot Girl Summer is coming to an end, get ready for Christian Girl Autumn\u201d.</p> <p>When the replies took off \u2013 along the lines of: \u201cThis picture asked to speak to my manager\u201d and, \u201cThis picture asked me not to kiss another man in public and if I could please leave the restaurant\u201d \u2013 the tweet eventually got back to the photo\u2019s real subjects. These were lifestyle bloggers Emily Gemma and Caitlin Covington, who objected to their depiction as clueless homophobes, but eventually got in on the joke, giving the story its happy ending. As Gemma <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/christian-girl-autumn-meme-caitlin-convington-emily-gemma\">told BuzzFeed</a>: \u201cI think people realised that not all white girls who love fall fashion and pumpkin spice are what we\u2019re all categorised to look like.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbcLcSY2au4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FbcLcSY2au4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Then there is \u201cHot Boy Summer\u201d. The equivalent of #AllLivesMatter or a Straight Pride parade, it is also therefore a hard \u201cno\u201d. Nah, nope, never gonna happen. Next! Not least because, as has been made clear by Tom Hanks in a sassily <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allbageldiet/status/1148666574234103809?lang=en\" title=\"\">front-tied shirt</a> or Tony Soprano on a lime-green lilo, men too enjoyed their Hot Girl Summer and have no need of a heavily gendered follow-up. The same goes for Soft Boi Autumn, suggested to coincide with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/11/bon-iver-i-i-review\">Bon Iver\u2019s</a> 30 August album release date.</p> <p>In terms of gender politics, Sad Girl Fall is a better shout. Elle magazine called it earlier this month, in a trend report characterised by sombre transition. We were informed that \u201cskin-tight mini dresses have evolved into voluminous gowns, cycling shorts have morphed into slouchy suits and vibrant neons have dulled to dark hues.\u201d Sad Girl Autumn makes sense, but it doesn\u2019t exactly pop with positivity, does it?</p> <p>What\u2019s needed is not so much a pendulum swing as a stylistic shift. During a discussion of her future plans in mid-August, Megan Thee Stallion herself suggested Hot Nerd Fall, which, crucially, still has the word \u201chot\u201d in it. \u201cEveryone knows I\u2019m still in college,\u201d she told Access Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a real hot girl semester, you know what I\u2019m saying? Real Hot Nerd Fall, so I\u2019m just about to start puttin\u2019 on for all my school girls.\u201d</p> <p>However, for Ashley Perna, a writer and comedian from Ontario, Canada, it\u2019s the \u201chot\u201d part that rankles. She\u2019s been tweeting instead about Awkward Woman Autumn: \u201cNothing at all against hot girl summer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I definitely don\u2019t always feel \u2018hot\u2019. Awkward Woman Autumn is about embracing what makes us unique style-wise while also being comfortable in our clothes \u2026 For example, I love the shape of my legs but not how pale they are. Autumn means tights, which is perfect for me!\u201d</p> <p>Some Hot Girl Summer follow-ups take the \u201chot\u201d and run with it; others are all about the \u201cgirl\u201d. Some embrace self-love, while others find \u201cself-acceptance\u201d a more obtainable seasonal goal. The important thing is that there is a decent selfie-posting excuse in there somewhere. Otherwise, what even is the point?</p> <p>Which brings us to \u201cModern Non-Binary Slag Harvest Time\u201d, a concept introduced by singer and musician Shy Charles in a September <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/B16Nhz0FBVi/\" title=\"\">Instagram post</a>. Charles envisages this as a time to \u201ctake your lover to a pumpkin field\u201d then post a selfie \u201cwearing warm autumnal hues\u201d. Why \u201cModern\u201d? \u201cIt is important to be as modern as you can, to really get the edge and participate in creating the culture of your own generation,\u201d they explain. Why \u201cHarvest Time\u201d? \u201cWe all need to ground ourselves with an earthy vibe and also practise gratitude.\u201d And the \u201cNon-Binary Slag\u201d part is self-evident: \u201cBeing neither man nor woman (or both), liking a good time and not caring who knows it; what\u2019s not to love?!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s only one thing, and that\u2019s the fact that Hot Girl Summer has to end. We can accept the changing of the seasons, but it\u2019s a shame if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2016/apr/11/how-blackgirlmagic-became-a-rallying-cry-for-women-of-colour\">Black Girl Magic</a> and body positivity of summer 2019 are dismissed as passing trends.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans look to be falling apart as the European commission said there are no grounds to accept a request from the UK for intensive weekend negotiations two weeks before an EU summit. EU sources said there was no basis for such discussions, given the British prime minister\u2019s insistence on there being a customs border on the island of Ireland. Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, along with a team of a dozen British officials, failed to convince their EU counterparts in Brussels on Friday that he had a mandate from Downing Street to compromise on what the EU sees as major flaws in the UK government\u2019s proposals. Frost had been seeking to rescue the British prime minister\u2019s proposed deal after it was strongly criticised. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had told diplomats on Thursday evening that the British needed to \u201cfundamentally amend their position\u201d. A European commission spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have completed discussions with the UK for today. We gave our initial reaction to the UK\u2019s proposals and asked many questions on the legal text. \u201cWe will meet again on Monday to give the UK another opportunity to present its proposals in detail.\u201d The spokeswoman added that the proposals did not \u201cprovide a basis for concluding an agreement\u201d.

The Northern Irish assembly, however, would retain a veto on the arrangements at the end of the standstill transition period in December 2020 and then every four years. Speaking in Denmark, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said the plan did not have the support of the people of Northern Ireland. \u201cI\u2019m interested in solutions; any solution has to have the support of the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s been put on the table by Mr Johnson is not supported by business or civil society in Northern Ireland; it\u2019s only supported by one political party, so there\u2019s a long way to go. \u201cDemocracy matters, and any agreement that affects Ireland deeply has to have support from people on both parts of the island.\u201d In response to the UK government\u2019s admission in court documents that the prime minister accepted he would have to ask for an extension to Britain\u2019s membership of the EU if a deal were not secured, Varadkar said he would support such a Brexit delay. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that Brexit doesn\u2019t end with the UK leaving, it\u2019s just the next phase of negotiations, but if the UK were to request an extension, we would consider it.

      "body": "<p>It is a Tuesday afternoon in mid-September and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tyler-the-creator\" title=\"\">Tyler, the Creator</a> has been in London since the weekend, when he flew in from New York to Heathrow. Going through customs was surprisingly smooth, he says. \u201cThe lady said: \u2018Hey, did you have a problem with immigration here in 2015?\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cI said, <em>yeah</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Four years ago, his experience was very different. The then 24-year-old rapper and musician, born Tyler Okonma, was supposed to be playing at Reading and Leeds festivals that summer. Instead, when he landed in the UK, he was taken into a detention room and shown lyrics from his first two albums: Bastard, a mixtape he had put out in 2009, when he was 18; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/19/tyler-the-creator-goblin-review\" title=\"\">Goblin, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/19/tyler-the-creator-goblin-review\" title=\"\">from 2011</a>. Okonma had been to the UK since those albums had come out (once, to host a screening of Napoleon Dynamite), but nevertheless he was told that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/01/tyler-the-creator-comments-banned-uk-freedom-of-speech\" title=\"\">he had been banned from the country for three to five years</a>. The home secretary at the time, Theresa May, used anti-terrorism legislation to forbid him entry, releasing an official statement that said his work \u201cencourages violence and intolerance of homosexuality\u201d and \u201cfosters hatred with views that seek to provoke others to terrorist acts\u201d.</p> <p>Today, Okonma laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, so I\u2019m back.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, the ban was controversial; looking back, it seems absurd, whatever you think of his output. Those who approved argued that Okonma was a homophobe and a misogynist. Certainly, his early records were peppered with \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cfaggot\u201d; on one track, Blow, he rapped from the perspective of Ted Bundy, the serial killer pop culture can\u2019t seem to leave alone. But Eminem, who built his early career on a cartoonishly violent alter ego, was never banned. When another American artist, Offset, rapped: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/in-rap-path-to-progress-is-merrily-crooked-offset\" title=\"\">I cannot vibe with queers</a>,\u201d in early 2018, he was forced to apologise, but his band, Migos, played a show in London two months later. It remains unclear why Okonma was singled out for music he had made years before and no longer performed.</p> <p>But his life and career have played out as a series of contradictions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/17/tyler-the-creator-igor-review\" title=\"\">H</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/17/tyler-the-creator-igor-review\" title=\"\">is most recent album, Igor</a>, is about a love affair with a man, and he has talked and rapped about his attraction to men for years. (On the track I Ain\u2019t Got Time!, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/21/tyler-the-creator-flower-boy-review\" title=\"\">his 2017 album Flower Boy</a>, Okonma rapped: \u201cNext line will have \u2019em like: \u2018Woah\u2019 / I\u2019ve been kissing white boys since 2004.\u201d) His work is increasingly subtle and inventive, and bold in its vision. As the opening line for his first big hit, 2011\u2019s Yonkers, goes: \u201cI\u2019m a fucking walking paradox / No, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Okonma is in the middle of an ambitious international tour; on the day we meet, he will play the second of three sold-out shows at Brixton Academy in London, his first gigs in the UK since the ban. (He attempted a surprise outdoor performance in nearby Peckham earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/18/us-rapper-tyler-the-creator-back-in-the-uk-after-ban-expires\" title=\"\">but </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/18/us-rapper-tyler-the-creator-back-in-the-uk-after-ban-expires\" title=\"\">it was pulled due to overcrowding</a>.) \u201cIt\u2019s been four years since I\u2019ve been back,\u201d he tells the audience from the stage in Brixton. \u201cSince this beautiful, flawless black skin was allowed in the country.\u201d The roar of the adoring young audience, many of them wearing Tyler merch, is deafening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97f20f24860085246c690bc98c487a7f761ab239\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97f20f24860085246c690bc98c487a7f761ab239/0_107_4000_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyler, The Creator performs live on stage at O2 Academy Brixton, London, on 16 September 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"583\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On stage in London last month. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As 2019 draws to a close, it is clear that Okonma has embarked on a new phase in his career. On Igor, which appeared unannounced in May, the former rap provocateur remodels himself as a blond-wigged, Warhol-esque funk and soul singer. It seems a conscious attempt at reinvention. Okonma, who arranged and produced everything on the record, keeps its many guest spots (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\" title=\"\">Kanye West</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/solange-knowles\" title=\"\">Solange Knowles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/11/slowthai-i-love-britain-great\" title=\"\">Slowthai</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/la-roux\" title=\"\">La Roux</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/pharrellwilliams\" title=\"\">Pharrell Williams</a>) low-key, listing them in the liner notes rather than alongside the track names. He plays with samples of Run DMC, Al Green and Ponderosa Twins Plus One and is inspired by 80s pop \u2013 Everything But The Girl and Sade. His baritone rap has mostly been replaced with singing in a higher register; tracks such as A Boy Is a Gun* and Earfquake are sentimental soul songs that brim with heartbreak and longing. One of the year\u2019s best records (and his first US No 1), Igor has brought him a new audience, some of whom tell him they don\u2019t like his old stuff \u2013 although, by the same token, some of the old audience prefer his earlier sounds.</p> <p>I am supposed to sit down with Okonma for an hour, in the studio after the Guardian\u2019s photoshoot, but the plan changes immediately. \u201cYou know you\u2019re coming with us, right? There\u2019s a record store I gotta hit,\u201d he says. Also, he wants to buy his mother some perfume. We spend the rest of the day driving around London \u2013 east, north, central \u2013 shopping and eating, talking and walking, with a revolving crew of friends and acquaintances who drop in and out. He gets bored quickly, but is easily pleased. Intensely serious one minute, the next he is sliding and twirling towards Vill, his stoic man-mountain of a bodyguard, and dry-humping him. Vill\u2019s strategy seems to be to fondly, patiently ignore it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1894cab45ab452ad0a3d16abaff8e4316166b3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1894cab45ab452ad0a3d16abaff8e4316166b3a/145_1220_5260_4535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Tyler, the Creator, against turquoise backdrop, photographed in London September 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"862\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cap, <a href=\"https://golflefleur.com/\">golflefleur.com</a>. <a href=\"https://www.matchesfashion.com/products/Comme-des-Gar%C3%A7ons-Shirt-Fleece-lined-striped-cotton-field-jacket-1288070\">Shirt</a>, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons.

When we go for a walk in central London, he is stopped every few seconds by fans wanting to say hi, bump fists and take selfies. (He doesn\u2019t do pictures; given the number of people asking, I see why.) Is it always like this when he is out? \u201cIt is now,\u201d he says. \u201cSince Igor.\u201d</p> <p>Undoing a ban on entering a country is a long and complicated process, Okonma explains, when we have made our way to the back of the car, with Vill riding up front. It took many lawyers and letters, much money and time. \u201cThen you get the official thumbs up. It was like: damn, <em>finally</em>, but it was so stupid to have to endure that. I got treated like a terrorist.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07f4bed7273e1bb270ebd53e7b28a070b727dc02\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/10/01/TYLER-GIF-1_opt_(1).gif\" alt=\"Tyler, the Creator\" width=\"620\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I feel like I won some invisible fight\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is certainly difficult to reconcile the rapper banned for hate speech with the puppyish man I meet, who is alternately enthusiastic and droll, sweet, smart, prone to penis gags and curious about everything. \u201cYeah. I got treated like I was a murderer,\u201d he says. He is wearing an emerald-green flat cap with matching knee-high socks that set off the green and gold of the grills on his teeth, a cricket jumper draped over his shoulders. <a href=\"https://golfwang.com/all/\" title=\"\">He has his own clothing line, Golf</a>, and his sharp look is part of the reason people\u2019s heads turn with whiplash speed when he passes by. His nails are painted with glitter and he has a laser beam of charisma, when he decides to turn it on. \u201cIt was kind of stupid, and after a while I was like: I don\u2019t even want to come back. But it was more the principle of: \u2018Y\u2019all really did this, over <em>this</em>? In comparison to other shit people do, that y\u2019all let in?\u2019 So I\u2019m happy that I got back. I feel like I won some invisible fight.\u201d</p> <p>Did the length of the ban surprise him? \u201cYeah, it surprised me. But then I remembered \u2013 I\u2019m dark-skinned, so, ahh, all right, I get it. I mean, I don\u2019t point my finger at that at first, but I looked at every outcome and I looked at every option.\u201d He makes a circle with his hands. \u201cAnd after doing that six times, then you say, OK, what\u2019s the difference between everyone else and me? And then you land on that.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The Tyler, the Creator story began when Okonma was a young skater in Los Angeles, hanging out with a group of friends who coalesced around the name <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all\" title=\"\">Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All</a>. The loose collective, shortened to Odd Future, was home to a number of acts who have since broken big: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/13/syd-the-internet-odd-future-interview-hive-mind\" title=\"\">the Internet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/07/earl-sweatshirt-some-rap-songs-review\" title=\"\">Earl Sweatshirt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-ocean\" title=\"\">Frank Ocean</a>, among others. Their brand of goofy nihilism was blithely immature and deliberately provocative and it flourished online: there were mixtapes, pop-up clothing shops, Jackass-style TV shows. The aesthetic was cartoonish, all doughnuts and cats, while the lyrics were blunt-force hate-everything teen rebellion.</p> <p>Many people go through an obnoxious adolescent phase, but Okonma became famous during his \u2013 and the evidence lingers in those old lyrics. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise that all the stupid shit they did, no one knows about it but the three people in their hometown. All the stupid shit I did, or said, was public.\u201d Does he regret any of it? \u201cOh no,\u201d he says, quickly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d</p> <p>He was raised in LA by his mother. It was just the two of them until he was eight, when she had a daughter. When he was a teenager, his mother moved to Sacramento, so he lived with his grandmother for four years. Is she still alive? \u201cNo, she died in, like, 2012. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d he booms. I wasn\u2019t going to, I say. \u201cPeople say that and it\u2019s like: what are you sorry about? Did you kill her? No. Cancer killed her.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f141f8d2576dd841dc5d322a78f9796bf594a2ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f141f8d2576dd841dc5d322a78f9796bf594a2ab/0_163_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Odd Future collective (from left) Mike G; Tyler, the Creator; Frank Ocean; Syd the Kyd; Left Brain; Domo Genesis; MC Hodgy Beats\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With the Odd Future collective, including Frank Ocean (centre).

He found it hard to fit in. \u201cThe stuff I was into was a little different to the other kids who looked like me. They liked basketball and sports and stuff like that, and I never liked it.\u201d He did, however, know how to rap. \u201cThat would get me the thumbs up. But I like skateboarding and I was like: check these moves out. And they weren\u2019t feeling it. I was super-annoying. I was really hyper, loud, class clown. Just sarcastic, witty, quick.\u201d He clicks his fingers. \u201cAgile.\u201d</p> <p>Was he ever diagnosed with anything? \u201cNah! I should have been, probably.\u201d He laughs. \u201cMy friends say I should have been. I\u2019m trying to be chill, but, man, I just have so much energy. I think I will be like that for ever. Which I\u2019m not mad at.\u201d As well as music and fashion, Okonma directs his own videos. He has done so from the beginning: he is responsible for the black and white clip for Yonkers, a fevered nightmare in which he appears to eat a cockroach that has been crawling all over his face, before his eyes turn black. In IFHY, he transforms himself into a plastic mannequin in a gaudy suburban dolls\u2019 house; his most recent, for A Boy Is a Gun*, has echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/31/photographer-cindy-sherman-first-uk-retrospective\" title=\"\">Cindy Sherman\u2019s Untitled Film Stills</a>. (In 2013, Kanye West revealed that he had asked Okonma to teach him how to make a music video.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3d3ab5e85900f483f1138bc52289751e1cbb914d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3ab5e85900f483f1138bc52289751e1cbb914d/688_315_1306_2809/465.jpg\" alt=\"Tyler, the Creator riding his bike in Los Angeles in September 2018\" width=\"465\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taking his bike for a spin.

Does his mind ever switch off? \u201cNah, not really. It\u2019s always music playing in my head, 24/7. I\u2019m always thinking about something, always looking. There\u2019s so much to look at.\u201d</p> <p>We arrive at Alan\u2019s in East Finchley, a crate-digger\u2019s secondhand paradise that was recommended by a friend. Okonma jumps out of the car and spends nearly an hour flicking through the racks, playing records, chatting to other customers and asking for tips. His manager tells me this is how they spend their time on tour, in music shops and vintage stores. Okonma has a ritual for hunting new sounds. If the artwork grabs him, he looks at the year. If it was made between 1974 and 1982, he will look to see who was involved; if it is a name he recognises, he will pick it up. He tries Roy Ayers\u2019 LP No Stranger To Love. Alan comes over to adjust the RPM (\u201cRoy would be very upset\u201d) as Okonma nods along to the track Don\u2019t Hide Your Love.</p> <p>Alan asks Okonma if he has a picture he can sign. \u201cI don\u2019t keep anything on me. I see this in the mirror all the time,\u201d he says, gesturing to his face. But he takes a picture outside instead and promises to send it. A schoolboy walks past, looking mildly confused, as if telling himself he couldn\u2019t have just seen Tyler, the Creator in the suburbs of north London.</p> <p>Back in the car, our conversation turns to Odd Future again. People tell Okonma all the time that it was a youth culture phenomenon, he says. \u201cI feel like people make it seem bigger than it really was. But I was living in it, so I guess it\u2019s different when you\u2019re in it. It just felt like this small internet thing.\u201d But its influence, and by extension his, can be felt all over pop. Pitchfork declared last year that \u201cOdd Future changed everything\u201d, praising its \u201cunruly creativity\u201d and its resistance to any one genre. It is even there in the gothic minimalism of LA teen sensation Billie Eilish, who wrote recently: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0EaWOqFoTu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=dlfix\" title=\"\">I would be nothing without you, Tyler, and everyone knows it</a>.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3cde0027062973228f4806c8fba07a994b3f4543\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cde0027062973228f4806c8fba07a994b3f4543/113_2154_5226_3818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyler, the Creator, photographed in London September 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"731\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cap and hoodie, <a href=\"https://golflefleur.com/\">golflefleur.com</a>.

Oh man, your parks are really good.\u201d A couple of days earlier, he and his friends rode their bikes to a hill \u2013 he is not sure which \u2013 to watch the sun set. \u201cIt was the most romantic scene I think I\u2019ve seen in my life. People were just playing cards and hanging out. I find little cheesy shit like that really cool.\u201d Does that mean he likes the UK now? \u201cYeah.\u201d A pause. \u201cYour food still sucks.\u201d </p> <p>Okonma flickers between thoughtful and clownish in the blink of an eye. In the past, his Twitter posts were so dry that it was hard to know whether he was being serious or not. In 2015, he tweeted: \u201cI tried to come out the damn closet like four days ago and no one cared hahahaha,\u201d and nobody seemed to take him at his word. \u201cSee, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d he says now. \u201cPeople always think I\u2019m being sarcastic if I give a compliment. It\u2019s weird, but it\u2019s gotten better.\u201d How so? \u201cI stopped being funny and joking. Publicly. I\u2019m still a goofball with my friends, but I like to keep that off the internet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"94a1788583411dea2c3df2a9cf623ffb0124060d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94a1788583411dea2c3df2a9cf623ffb0124060d/272_0_2586_4737/546.jpg\" alt=\"Tyler, the Creator at the Grammy Awards,  New York, 28 Jan 2018\" width=\"546\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At last year\u2019s Grammys.

For instance: \u201cScary Movie 2 is one of my favourite movies. She gets <em>stabbed</em> on stage \u2013 but it\u2019s acting, in a beauty pageant, so they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s so good.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, he seems to enjoy the confusion \u2013 most of the time. When he was banned for being homophobic, it hurt. \u201cBro! That\u2019s the <em>thing</em>, bro. People <em>knew</em> I wasn\u2019t. People knew the intent!\u201d He points out of the window. \u201cThat <em>tree</em> over there could be a faggot! Who hasn\u2019t played Call Of Duty online and heard some 11-year-old call you that because you killed him? You knew the intent behind it and then people were faking, like, he\u2019s homophobic? That was pissing me off. It\u2019s just another word.\u201d</p> <p>One of his favourite rappers as a kid was Eminem. But when Okonma said he thought a new Eminem track was \u201chorrible\u201d, Eminem responded by including him on a diss track, Fall, with the line: \u201cTyler create nothing, I see why you call yourself a faggot, bitch.\u201d There was widespread criticism; Bon Iver, who featured on the track, tweeted that <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/bon-ivers-justin-vernon-on-his-eminem-collaboration-not-a-fan-of-the-message/\" title=\"\">he had asked for it </a><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/bon-ivers-justin-vernon-on-his-eminem-collaboration-not-a-fan-of-the-message/\" title=\"\">to be </a><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/bon-ivers-justin-vernon-on-his-eminem-collaboration-not-a-fan-of-the-message/\" title=\"\">changed</a>: \u201cNot a fan of the message, it\u2019s tired.\u201d In an interview, <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/eminem-says-homophobic-tyler-the-creator-diss-went-too-far/\" title=\"\">Eminem </a><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/eminem-says-homophobic-tyler-the-creator-diss-went-too-far/\" title=\"\">said later that he had gone too far</a>: \u201cIn my quest to hurt him, I realise that I was hurting a lot of other people by saying it.\u201d</p> <p>What was it like to be called that? \u201cOK,\u201d says Okonma, looking me dead in the eye. \u201cDid you ever hear me publicly say anything about that? Because I knew what the intent was. He felt pressured because people got offended for me. Don\u2019t get offended for me. We were playing Grand Theft Auto when we heard that. We rewound it and were like: \u2018Oh.\u2019\u201d He shrugs. \u201cAnd then kept playing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f94e35faab224b0713242ea811b17e023de31301\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f94e35faab224b0713242ea811b17e023de31301/0_1243_4999_4437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Tyler, the Creator, against turquoise backdrop, photographed in London September 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"888\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumper, <a href=\"https://www.lacoste.com/gb/homepage\">lacoste.com</a>.

Then we walk, and then he is hungry, so we duck into a burger place. When he is waiting, or understimulated, you get flashes of the taunting, cartoonish Tyler, the Creator character, bored and in search of a reaction. He holds the point of a steak knife under his chin and stares at me. He puts it down and picks it up again, pressing it gently into the flesh of his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d he says, gravely, then does it again. \u201cYes it is.\u201d He shows me an old scar on his forearm, which he got by testing the sharpness of a friend\u2019s knife (turned out it was really sharp). He is wearing a plastic beaded wristband and I ask him what it says. \u201cIt says Jay-Z,\u201d he fibs. \u201cI found it at a funeral.\u201d It reads \u201cOne of One\u201d.</p> <p>Okonma walks his own path. He doesn\u2019t drink and never has. He doesn\u2019t like the night-time; he much prefers the day. He rides his bike whenever he can. He rarely hangs out with rappers. He doesn\u2019t take drugs. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen cocaine in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t like to hang around with people who indulge in that.\u201d The mark he has made on pop culture is plain, although he disputes that his sound has been particularly influential. \u201cI just think I\u2019ve influenced how people present certain things, whether it\u2019s clothes or fashion or how their videos are. I allowed some people to just be freer. I mean, I hope I have. I hope I allow people to know that there\u2019s no rules and they can do whatever they want, artistically.\u201d</p> <p>It has been made easier by the fact that he genuinely doesn\u2019t seem to care what people think of him. \u201cI always did what I want. I always knew I\u2019d be successful, since I was eight.\u201d He seems amused that I find this funny. \u201cThink of me and my personality and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat else would I be good at?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is a Tuesday afternoon in mid-September and Tyler, the Creator has been in London since the weekend, when he flew in from New York to Heathrow. Going through customs was surprisingly smooth, he says. \u201cThe lady said: \u2018Hey, did you have a problem with immigration here in 2015?\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cI said, yeah.\u201d Four years ago, his experience was very different. The then 24-year-old rapper and musician, born Tyler Okonma, was supposed to be playing at Reading and Leeds festivals that summer. Instead, when he landed in the UK, he was taken into a detention room and shown lyrics from his first two albums: Bastard, a mixtape he had put out in 2009, when he was 18; and Goblin, from 2011. Okonma had been to the UK since those albums had come out (once, to host a screening of Napoleon Dynamite), but nevertheless he was told that he had been banned from the country for three to five years. The home secretary at the time, Theresa May, used anti-terrorism legislation to forbid him entry, releasing an official statement that said his work \u201cencourages violence and intolerance of homosexuality\u201d and \u201cfosters hatred with views that seek to provoke others to terrorist acts\u201d. Today, Okonma laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, so I\u2019m back.\u201d At the time, the ban was controversial; looking back, it seems absurd, whatever you think of his output. Those who approved argued that Okonma was a homophobe and a misogynist. Certainly, his early records were peppered with \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cfaggot\u201d; on one track, Blow, he rapped from the perspective of Ted Bundy, the serial killer pop culture can\u2019t seem to leave alone. But Eminem, who built his early career on a cartoonishly violent alter ego, was never banned. When another American artist, Offset, rapped: \u201cI cannot vibe with queers,\u201d in early 2018, he was forced to apologise, but his band, Migos, played a show in London two months later. It remains unclear why Okonma was singled out for music he had made years before and no longer performed. But his life and career have played out as a series of contradictions. His most recent album, Igor, is about a love affair with a man, and he has talked and rapped about his attraction to men for years. (On the track I Ain\u2019t Got Time!, from his 2017 album Flower Boy, Okonma rapped: \u201cNext line will have \u2019em like: \u2018Woah\u2019 / I\u2019ve been kissing white boys since 2004.\u201d) His work is increasingly subtle and inventive, and bold in its vision. As the opening line for his first big hit, 2011\u2019s Yonkers, goes: \u201cI\u2019m a fucking walking paradox / No, I\u2019m not.\u201d Okonma is in the middle of an ambitious international tour; on the day we meet, he will play the second of three sold-out shows at Brixton Academy in London, his first gigs in the UK since the ban. (He attempted a surprise outdoor performance in nearby Peckham earlier this year, but it was pulled due to overcrowding.) \u201cIt\u2019s been four years since I\u2019ve been back,\u201d he tells the audience from the stage in Brixton. \u201cSince this beautiful, flawless black skin was allowed in the country.\u201d The roar of the adoring young audience, many of them wearing Tyler merch, is deafening. As 2019 draws to a close, it is clear that Okonma has embarked on a new phase in his career. On Igor, which appeared unannounced in May, the former rap provocateur remodels himself as a blond-wigged, Warhol-esque funk and soul singer. It seems a conscious attempt at reinvention. Okonma, who arranged and produced everything on the record, keeps its many guest spots (Kanye West, Solange Knowles, Slowthai, La Roux, Pharrell Williams) low-key, listing them in the liner notes rather than alongside the track names. He plays with samples of Run DMC, Al Green and Ponderosa Twins Plus One and is inspired by 80s pop \u2013 Everything But The Girl and Sade. His baritone rap has mostly been replaced with singing in a higher register; tracks such as A Boy Is a Gun* and Earfquake are sentimental soul songs that brim with heartbreak and longing. One of the year\u2019s best records (and his first US No 1), Igor has brought him a new audience, some of whom tell him they don\u2019t like his old stuff \u2013 although, by the same token, some of the old audience prefer his earlier sounds. I am supposed to sit down with Okonma for an hour, in the studio after the Guardian\u2019s photoshoot, but the plan changes immediately. \u201cYou know you\u2019re coming with us, right? There\u2019s a record store I gotta hit,\u201d he says. Also, he wants to buy his mother some perfume. We spend the rest of the day driving around London \u2013 east, north, central \u2013 shopping and eating, talking and walking, with a revolving crew of friends and acquaintances who drop in and out. He gets bored quickly, but is easily pleased. Intensely serious one minute, the next he is sliding and twirling towards Vill, his stoic man-mountain of a bodyguard, and dry-humping him. Vill\u2019s strategy seems to be to fondly, patiently ignore it. Oddly, as Okonma\u2019s notoriety has subsided, his fame seems to have risen. When we go for a walk in central London, he is stopped every few seconds by fans wanting to say hi, bump fists and take selfies. (He doesn\u2019t do pictures; given the number of people asking, I see why.) Is it always like this when he is out? \u201cIt is now,\u201d he says. \u201cSince Igor.\u201d Undoing a ban on entering a country is a long and complicated process, Okonma explains, when we have made our way to the back of the car, with Vill riding up front. It took many lawyers and letters, much money and time. \u201cThen you get the official thumbs up. It was like: damn, finally, but it was so stupid to have to endure that. I got treated like a terrorist.\u201d It is certainly difficult to reconcile the rapper banned for hate speech with the puppyish man I meet, who is alternately enthusiastic and droll, sweet, smart, prone to penis gags and curious about everything. \u201cYeah. I got treated like I was a murderer,\u201d he says. He is wearing an emerald-green flat cap with matching knee-high socks that set off the green and gold of the grills on his teeth, a cricket jumper draped over his shoulders. He has his own clothing line, Golf, and his sharp look is part of the reason people\u2019s heads turn with whiplash speed when he passes by. His nails are painted with glitter and he has a laser beam of charisma, when he decides to turn it on. \u201cIt was kind of stupid, and after a while I was like: I don\u2019t even want to come back. But it was more the principle of: \u2018Y\u2019all really did this, over this? In comparison to other shit people do, that y\u2019all let in?\u2019 So I\u2019m happy that I got back. I feel like I won some invisible fight.\u201d Did the length of the ban surprise him? \u201cYeah, it surprised me. But then I remembered \u2013 I\u2019m dark-skinned, so, ahh, all right, I get it. I mean, I don\u2019t point my finger at that at first, but I looked at every outcome and I looked at every option.\u201d He makes a circle with his hands. \u201cAnd after doing that six times, then you say, OK, what\u2019s the difference between everyone else and me? And then you land on that.\u201d *** The Tyler, the Creator story began when Okonma was a young skater in Los Angeles, hanging out with a group of friends who coalesced around the name Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All. The loose collective, shortened to Odd Future, was home to a number of acts who have since broken big: the Internet, Earl Sweatshirt and Frank Ocean, among others. Their brand of goofy nihilism was blithely immature and deliberately provocative and it flourished online: there were mixtapes, pop-up clothing shops, Jackass-style TV shows. The aesthetic was cartoonish, all doughnuts and cats, while the lyrics were blunt-force hate-everything teen rebellion. Many people go through an obnoxious adolescent phase, but Okonma became famous during his \u2013 and the evidence lingers in those old lyrics. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise that all the stupid shit they did, no one knows about it but the three people in their hometown. All the stupid shit I did, or said, was public.\u201d Does he regret any of it? \u201cOh no,\u201d he says, quickly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d He was raised in LA by his mother. It was just the two of them until he was eight, when she had a daughter. When he was a teenager, his mother moved to Sacramento, so he lived with his grandmother for four years. Is she still alive? \u201cNo, she died in, like, 2012. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d he booms. I wasn\u2019t going to, I say. \u201cPeople say that and it\u2019s like: what are you sorry about? Did you kill her? No. Cancer killed her.\u201d He moved a lot, which meant he changed schools every year or so. He found it hard to fit in. \u201cThe stuff I was into was a little different to the other kids who looked like me. They liked basketball and sports and stuff like that, and I never liked it.\u201d He did, however, know how to rap. \u201cThat would get me the thumbs up. But I like skateboarding and I was like: check these moves out. And they weren\u2019t feeling it. I was super-annoying. I was really hyper, loud, class clown. Just sarcastic, witty, quick.\u201d He clicks his fingers. \u201cAgile.\u201d Was he ever diagnosed with anything? \u201cNah! I should have been, probably.\u201d He laughs. \u201cMy friends say I should have been. I\u2019m trying to be chill, but, man, I just have so much energy. I think I will be like that for ever. Which I\u2019m not mad at.\u201d As well as music and fashion, Okonma directs his own videos. He has done so from the beginning: he is responsible for the black and white clip for Yonkers, a fevered nightmare in which he appears to eat a cockroach that has been crawling all over his face, before his eyes turn black. In IFHY, he transforms himself into a plastic mannequin in a gaudy suburban dolls\u2019 house; his most recent, for A Boy Is a Gun*, has echoes of Cindy Sherman\u2019s Untitled Film Stills. (In 2013, Kanye West revealed that he had asked Okonma to teach him how to make a music video.) He also runs the festival Camp Flog Gnaw, at the Dodger stadium in LA, although he insists that making music will always be his principal passion \u2013 everything else is \u201ca spider web\u201d. Does his mind ever switch off? \u201cNah, not really. It\u2019s always music playing in my head, 24/7. I\u2019m always thinking about something, always looking. There\u2019s so much to look at.\u201d We arrive at Alan\u2019s in East Finchley, a crate-digger\u2019s secondhand paradise that was recommended by a friend. Okonma jumps out of the car and spends nearly an hour flicking through the racks, playing records, chatting to other customers and asking for tips. His manager tells me this is how they spend their time on tour, in music shops and vintage stores. Okonma has a ritual for hunting new sounds. If the artwork grabs him, he looks at the year. If it was made between 1974 and 1982, he will look to see who was involved; if it is a name he recognises, he will pick it up. He tries Roy Ayers\u2019 LP No Stranger To Love. Alan comes over to adjust the RPM (\u201cRoy would be very upset\u201d) as Okonma nods along to the track Don\u2019t Hide Your Love. Alan asks Okonma if he has a picture he can sign. \u201cI don\u2019t keep anything on me. I see this in the mirror all the time,\u201d he says, gesturing to his face. But he takes a picture outside instead and promises to send it. A schoolboy walks past, looking mildly confused, as if telling himself he couldn\u2019t have just seen Tyler, the Creator in the suburbs of north London. Back in the car, our conversation turns to Odd Future again. People tell Okonma all the time that it was a youth culture phenomenon, he says. \u201cI feel like people make it seem bigger than it really was. But I was living in it, so I guess it\u2019s different when you\u2019re in it. It just felt like this small internet thing.\u201d But its influence, and by extension his, can be felt all over pop. Pitchfork declared last year that \u201cOdd Future changed everything\u201d, praising its \u201cunruly creativity\u201d and its resistance to any one genre. It is even there in the gothic minimalism of LA teen sensation Billie Eilish, who wrote recently: \u201cI would be nothing without you, Tyler, and everyone knows it.\u201d Okonma resists being pushed on why the collective struck such a chord, but he guesses that what they were doing just seemed new. \u201cIt spoke to people differently, in the sense that everything coming from Los Angeles was gang culture, low riders and Dr Dre \u2013 and we weren\u2019t that at all.\u201d He is distracted by the view from the window, a long sweep of Finsbury Park. \u201cMan, a lot of really pretty parks! Oh man, your parks are really good.\u201d A couple of days earlier, he and his friends rode their bikes to a hill \u2013 he is not sure which \u2013 to watch the sun set. \u201cIt was the most romantic scene I think I\u2019ve seen in my life. People were just playing cards and hanging out. I find little cheesy shit like that really cool.\u201d Does that mean he likes the UK now? \u201cYeah.\u201d A pause. \u201cYour food still sucks.\u201d Okonma flickers between thoughtful and clownish in the blink of an eye. In the past, his Twitter posts were so dry that it was hard to know whether he was being serious or not. In 2015, he tweeted: \u201cI tried to come out the damn closet like four days ago and no one cared hahahaha,\u201d and nobody seemed to take him at his word. \u201cSee, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d he says now. \u201cPeople always think I\u2019m being sarcastic if I give a compliment. It\u2019s weird, but it\u2019s gotten better.\u201d How so? \u201cI stopped being funny and joking. Publicly. I\u2019m still a goofball with my friends, but I like to keep that off the internet.\u201d It is funny that he had to come out again and again before anyone took him seriously. \u201cYeah.\u201d He likens it to a performance where nobody knows what is real. For instance: \u201cScary Movie 2 is one of my favourite movies. She gets stabbed on stage \u2013 but it\u2019s acting, in a beauty pageant, so they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s so good.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless, he seems to enjoy the confusion \u2013 most of the time. When he was banned for being homophobic, it hurt. \u201cBro! That\u2019s the thing, bro. People knew I wasn\u2019t. People knew the intent!\u201d He points out of the window. \u201cThat tree over there could be a faggot! Who hasn\u2019t played Call Of Duty online and heard some 11-year-old call you that because you killed him? You knew the intent behind it and then people were faking, like, he\u2019s homophobic? That was pissing me off. It\u2019s just another word.\u201d One of his favourite rappers as a kid was Eminem. But when Okonma said he thought a new Eminem track was \u201chorrible\u201d, Eminem responded by including him on a diss track, Fall, with the line: \u201cTyler create nothing, I see why you call yourself a faggot, bitch.\u201d There was widespread criticism; Bon Iver, who featured on the track, tweeted that he had asked for it to be changed: \u201cNot a fan of the message, it\u2019s tired.\u201d In an interview, Eminem said later that he had gone too far: \u201cIn my quest to hurt him, I realise that I was hurting a lot of other people by saying it.\u201d What was it like to be called that? \u201cOK,\u201d says Okonma, looking me dead in the eye. \u201cDid you ever hear me publicly say anything about that? Because I knew what the intent was. He felt pressured because people got offended for me. Don\u2019t get offended for me. We were playing Grand Theft Auto when we heard that. We rewound it and were like: \u2018Oh.\u2019\u201d He shrugs. \u201cAnd then kept playing.\u201d He asks the driver to pull over \u2013 he has seen a newsagent and he wants to buy a magazine. Then we walk, and then he is hungry, so we duck into a burger place. When he is waiting, or understimulated, you get flashes of the taunting, cartoonish Tyler, the Creator character, bored and in search of a reaction. He holds the point of a steak knife under his chin and stares at me. He puts it down and picks it up again, pressing it gently into the flesh of his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d he says, gravely, then does it again. \u201cYes it is.\u201d He shows me an old scar on his forearm, which he got by testing the sharpness of a friend\u2019s knife (turned out it was really sharp). He is wearing a plastic beaded wristband and I ask him what it says. \u201cIt says Jay-Z,\u201d he fibs. \u201cI found it at a funeral.\u201d It reads \u201cOne of One\u201d. Okonma walks his own path. He doesn\u2019t drink and never has. He doesn\u2019t like the night-time; he much prefers the day. He rides his bike whenever he can. He rarely hangs out with rappers. He doesn\u2019t take drugs. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen cocaine in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t like to hang around with people who indulge in that.\u201d The mark he has made on pop culture is plain, although he disputes that his sound has been particularly influential. \u201cI just think I\u2019ve influenced how people present certain things, whether it\u2019s clothes or fashion or how their videos are. I allowed some people to just be freer. I mean, I hope I have. I hope I allow people to know that there\u2019s no rules and they can do whatever they want, artistically.\u201d It has been made easier by the fact that he genuinely doesn\u2019t seem to care what people think of him. \u201cI always did what I want. I always knew I\u2019d be successful, since I was eight.\u201d He seems amused that I find this funny. \u201cThink of me and my personality and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat else would I be good at?\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Was it job done, move forward. Or were there still flies in the ointment - suggestions that this is a team still not playing the kind of rugby you need to win championships?</p> <p>The players and staff will tell you World Cups are marathons not sprints - and with plenty of bodies rested, no major injuries, the win and a bonus point, Michael Cheika will presumably be relieved with the showing.</p> <p>Twelve penalties, two yellow cards and nine turnovers coughed up. At times the forwards were too slow to the breakdown, the ball retention remained and issue, and long-term problems like what is Australia\u2019s best halves combination look no closer to being solved.</p> <p>There\u2019s plenty of time for all that to be addressed though, with six days before the next hitout against Georgia, and a fortnight before the knockout stages.</p> <p>A tenacious effort from Uruguay, but they\u2019ll depart nursing a few disappointments of their own. The late try to Diana a great reward for their industry - another brick in the wall along their pathway to full professionalism.</p> <p>We\u2019ll lean glass half-full for the Wallabies. Despite another poor start it was an accomplished second half performance and they did what they needed to. If they can get through Georgia unscathed they\u2019ll have plenty of minutes in the tank but still have a few bodies well-rested for when the tournament really heats up.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9848ea8f08fbb0c172158f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-05T07:41:39.989Z\">8.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s our eyes on the job, John Davidson, with the full-time match report.</p> <p>Looks like he too has lasered in on that TMO/referee discussion around Adam Coleman\u2019s yellow card:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/oct/05/refereeing-mars-australias-rugby-world-cup-win-over-uruguay\">Refereeing mars Australia's Rugby World Cup win over Uruguay</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9847ad8f084ab8417330b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-05T07:38:56.815Z\">8.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So a look at the standings from Pool D after that result:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fixtures-tables-and-results\">Rugby World Cup 2019: fixtures, tables and results</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My idiot savant\u2019s read is that unless Fiji stun Wales and Australia slip up against Georgia, this should effective seal the Wallabies\u2019 progression to the knockout phase, yes?</p> <p>Or does head-to-head come into effect, given Australia\u2019s win over Fiji?

They thought they had a try in the shadow of half time, which could have made it 19-10 at the break. But surely with two yellow card advantages - both which only yielded tries for Australia - they Uruguayan staff will rue their inability to make that count; play selection, game management, smart tactical rugby.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9842248f084ab8417330a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-05T07:13:53.879Z\">8.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So, how to appraise that performance from Australia?</p> <p>A win, no major injuries, a bonus point. A try on debut for Jordan Petaia, and a first try for the veteran James Slipper in his 90-something-th Test. Surely job done?</p> <p>And yet.

Just ask John McKee and the staff of Fiji, whose tournament hopes now lie in tatters, after the \u201cGrab-and-Smashi of Kaimashi\u201d, where the unfancied Los Teros emerged 30-27 victors.</p> <p>In theory, lighting doesn\u2019t strike twice, and you could argue that Australia have too much talent across the park for Uruguay to even come close.

      "bodyText": "A tough one to assess for Australia. Was it job done, move forward. Or were there still flies in the ointment - suggestions that this is a team still not playing the kind of rugby you need to win championships? The players and staff will tell you World Cups are marathons not sprints - and with plenty of bodies rested, no major injuries, the win and a bonus point, Michael Cheika will presumably be relieved with the showing. Twelve penalties, two yellow cards and nine turnovers coughed up. At times the forwards were too slow to the breakdown, the ball retention remained and issue, and long-term problems like what is Australia\u2019s best halves combination look no closer to being solved. There\u2019s plenty of time for all that to be addressed though, with six days before the next hitout against Georgia, and a fortnight before the knockout stages. A tenacious effort from Uruguay, but they\u2019ll depart nursing a few disappointments of their own. The late try to Diana a great reward for their industry - another brick in the wall along their pathway to full professionalism. We\u2019ll lean glass half-full for the Wallabies. Despite another poor start it was an accomplished second half performance and they did what they needed to. If they can get through Georgia unscathed they\u2019ll have plenty of minutes in the tank but still have a few bodies well-rested for when the tournament really heats up. And here\u2019s our eyes on the job, John Davidson, with the full-time match report. Looks like he too has lasered in on that TMO/referee discussion around Adam Coleman\u2019s yellow card: So a look at the standings from Pool D after that result: My idiot savant\u2019s read is that unless Fiji stun Wales and Australia slip up against Georgia, this should effective seal the Wallabies\u2019 progression to the knockout phase, yes? Or does head-to-head come into effect, given Australia\u2019s win over Fiji? Who can say - let\u2019s just presume the Wallabies can get it done in six days time against the Kings of the Caucasus. So - as discussed previously - it\u2019s a huge triple header of rugby from the Japan World Cup. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to fix the roof, or trim the hedge, because the action won\u2019t stop at Guardian play-by-play. Once more into the fray is the redoubtable Barry Glendenning - he\u2019s your eyes on the prize for the must-win clash for Argentina, as they face England: Tevita Kuridrani is announced as player of the match. Two tries, 120m run, nine defenders beaten. A good day out for the Brumbies backrower capitalising on a rare start. Impressive metres also from Dempsey (97m) and Ashley-Cooper (65m) - the latter only on for 40 minutes, with six defenders beaten, while it was Coleman and Salakaia-Loto who led the defence with 13 tackles each. Making amends, perhaps - given they were the two players to get 10 minute yellow-card enforced rests for Australia. Michael Cheika cuts a reasonably pleased figure post-match. He wasn\u2019t happy with the start though: \u201cWe\u2019ve started slow again; that\u2019s three times at this World Cup where we\u2019ve started cold. I dunno, maybe I better tweak my pre-match speech, but we have to do better in that regard\u201d. Otherwise he\u2019s happy once again with the set piece, and congratulates the fringe players who have stepped in and put their hands up for selection. Uruguay for their part showed valour and endeavour. They thought they had a try in the shadow of half time, which could have made it 19-10 at the break. But surely with two yellow card advantages - both which only yielded tries for Australia - they Uruguayan staff will rue their inability to make that count; play selection, game management, smart tactical rugby. So, how to appraise that performance from Australia? A win, no major injuries, a bonus point. A try on debut for Jordan Petaia, and a first try for the veteran James Slipper in his 90-something-th Test. Surely job done? And yet. Two first half yellow cards after a series of needless head-high tackles. Sloppy ball retention. More missed conversion attempts. If you\u2019re a top five nation watching this, have you seen too many weaknesses in this Wallabies side? 80 min: So a final lineout feed from Australia. They look to spread wide, Toomua hits the line. They look for Kuridrani wide, but he\u2019s out of real estate. And it\u2019s Pocock who is bundled over at the death, and that\u2019s the game. Comfortable in the end, and they pick up the bonus point, Australia. Uruguay with a late reward for their endeavour, but they may still feel they could have done a little better here. 78 min: Yes! There it is. The fans love it, the coach goes up. And what a deserving scorer. It\u2019s Diana, who\u2019s got through an absolute power of work today. Berchesi with the conversion, and they hit double figures, Uruguay. Well deserved. 77 min: Tough metres, these. The forwards have seen enough dropped ball in the backs and are doing it themselves. They roll 10 phases, Uruguay. They\u2019re about 2m short now. 1m short. Finally they swing wide, and Berchesi is so close! Great defence this, from Australia. We have 18 phases. And is this it?! 75 min: We reset the scrum. They\u2019re so keen, Uruguay - you can almost smell the desperation to get the try they were so cruelly denied just before the break. It\u2019s a huge scrum push from Australia, but they retain possession, Los Teros. It\u2019s one-out pick and driving, but the Wallabies are expecting it and counter-hitting in numbers. 74 min: Are they over?! Held up is the call. An absolute weight of bodies over the line, but no daylight to get it down. We come back for a 5m scrum. 72 min: They play quick out of the lineout, and make it almost to the line! Pulled down a metre short. They\u2019re forced backwards, before setting for a pick and drive. Pocock looms ominously - they need to get this right, Uruguay. Big rhythmic clapping around the stadium - the neutrals want a try as well. 70 min: Penalty against Australia for kicking the ball away from the ruck. A quick tap - you can\u2019t fault the endeavour of the Uruguayans, but the execution just hasn\u2019t been there, unfortunately. They\u2019ve earned another penalty on this occasion though - and they kick to the corner. Big offensive lineout opportunity. Any hope for a monster maul to crash over? 68 min: A bit of broken play, but Australia capitalise and swing it well to the corner. It\u2019s a double for Haylett-Petty, this will help build his morale. We have a TMO wait, to check for a possible obstruction. Fair play, Raynal, he showed common sense there. A tricky one for Leali\u2019ifano, and he doesn\u2019t get it. A first miss of the second half. 66 min: Australia set the scrum, and spread wide for another Ashley-Cooper scurry. Toomua kicks crossfield for Salakaia-Loto - but he doesn\u2019t hold the ball. It\u2019s another shabby lineout feed - maybe time for a spell for Kessler? They do have Jaunsolo still on the bench, Uruguay. 64 min: So, what can Uruguay do now. They need to dig deep - Australia are really playing with the tails up. Some more subs from both sides, as Rombys goes on a run. Haylett-Petty pinged for not rolling away, and a slight glimmer for Uruguay to go back on the attack. They haven\u2019t seen much of it in the Australian half. And oh my - not in straight is the call from the attacking lineout. A big error. Costly stuff, Uruguay. 61 min: Wallabies scrum, 5m out. They\u2019re just short, but they go wide - and can you believe this!! It\u2019s the big number one - James Slipper. What\u2019s this - Test number 90-something, and it\u2019s his first ever Wallabies try! Jubilant celebrations from his teammates, they\u2019re buzzing for him. And he leaves the field to a huge ovation. Leali\u2019ifano knocks another one over. This is better today, but for one that he should have got. 59 min: Penalty Australia, this time Uruguay with a high tackle on Toomua. No ill effect, he\u2019s boomed a kick about 45m to roll just inside the corner flag. Lovely from Toomua. He\u2019s really pressing for a start come knockout stages. Maybe his wife Ellyse Perry has been giving him some championship-mentality pep talks. 57 min: An injury concern for Ardao, but he\u2019s back on his feet now. This is much better stuff from Australia. In fairness, they have been finishing their games better than they\u2019ve started so far at this World Cup - call it superior fitness? Deeper benches? Or just a Cheika rocket at half-time? 56 min: Terrific run from Adam Ashley-Cooper! He makes 20-30m, and does brilliantly to keep the ball in play with a fast counter-attack, but the fullback Silva does well to bundle Beale into touch in the subsequent play. 54 min: So, some real danger minutes for the Uruguayans. Their only ever meeting with Australia finished 65-3. They\u2019ll be keen to show they\u2019ve made big progress since the World Cup four years ago. 52 min: How\u2019s that for a start! His first touch off the bench, and it\u2019s the replacement scrum-half who crosses. Again it\u2019s Dempsey with the bust - he beats two, three players. Great set up from the big running forward. Lovely stuff. Leali\u2019ifano about 6-8m in from touch. Again, it\u2019s the curler - and it comes back in between the sticks. Extras added. 51 min: It\u2019s a big \u201cno thank you\u201d from Kuridrani who fends off a would-be tackler - isn\u2019t he making the most of his start. This is moving nicely - but it\u2019s another knock on! This time Fainga\u2019a, puts it down. Cheika shuffles his pack - Pocock and Genia come on, White and Hooper make way. A tasty little F-bomb caught by the camera. Let\u2019s just say the moustachio-ed Nic White was \u201cfairly sore\u201d about getting hooked. 50 min:Australian scrum feed, and they play the short side. They\u2019re about 10m out from the Uruguayan line - ominous stuff, this again from the Wallabies. 48 min: And from the restart it\u2019s another great bust - this time the backrower Dempsey! Did they get a bee in their ear at half-time, the Wallabies? They\u2019ve exploded out of the blocks, this half. Now, in the spirit of knit-picking: say Dempsey had scored then, and we came back to examine that; was their offside players ahead of the ball carrier? It\u2019s a can of worms, the TMO fine-toothing. 46 min: Ooh, ahh. A quick lineout, and what a line from the outside centre! His Brumbies\u2019 teammate Leali\u2019ifano finds the perfect pass, and it\u2019s an explosive take and carry. Blistering pace - they\u2019re not catching him! And Leali\u2019ifano adds the extras, another nice bending effort. 44 min: Gee, he\u2019s in a mood - it\u2019s Tupou again! Another great carry, but he\u2019s just dropped it cold. A shame, knock on and a Uruguayan scrum 5m out from their own line. 42 min: Precaution is the word from the Wallabies bench - Petaia did have a wee hamstring concern ahead of camp, so just the 40 minutes for his debut then. We settle for a Uruguayan lineout feed, just inside their 22m, but he can\u2019t make it stick. And it\u2019s Tupou off on a barnstorming run! Great metres by the front rower. Second half! But enough about that - let\u2019s return to the action. A few half-time changes for the Australians, I\u2019ll update those as soon as I have confirmation. Ashley-Cooper and Tupou are the new men - and it\u2019s the debutant Petaia and Alaalatoa who make way. Now - plenty has been said about the refereeing at this tournament, and akin to VAR in the world of football, much of the complaint has come certainly from the \u201cnewness\u201d of having the benefit of replays and a TMO. Take that Uruguayan disallowed try, for example - no Australians complained; I don\u2019t know that the technical error was picked up by anyone - is it too much fine-tooth combing to chalk something like that off? I imagine nobody wants a game where TMO\u2019s are forensically combing every action during the build up to tries. How many minor infringements occur in rugby that go unpunished, for example. And rightly so, if they don\u2019t have a dramatic effect on the outcome. Or is technical correctness the ultimate aspiration? So, your thoughts on that opening stanza? The scoreboard suggests it was positive for Australia, but some poor ill discipline - two yellow cards and nine penalties conceded - you can\u2019t imagine Michael Cheika would be happy with that. For Uruguay, some bright moments, but far too many easy turnovers. Yes, there\u2019s been heavy contact, but ball retention has to be paramount. And they needed to do more with two yellow card advantages. Some inexperience perhaps in not managing those ten-minute spells better? 40 min: Australia look to play past the gong, but it ends up with a ball to ground. And that\u2019s all we see. Forty down, and with that late disallowal, now a mountain to climb for Uruguay. Ooph. What absolute pantomine villains these referees are! Manuel Diana who picks up the ball to start the move is adjudged to have been offside to have sparked that whole move - and they\u2019ve scratched the try off! Party poopers. 39 min: It\u2019s a box kick looking for the winger, but Petaia rises high and claims. There\u2019s no scrum half there to get it though, and it\u2019s an easy pick up and run for Uruguay! The outside centre says, yes please, and he scampers off to the corner. 37 min: A few more scrum re-sets. Again, this only runs down the minutes in which Uruguay have to play against 14. It\u2019s another turnover, and now the South Americans have a chance to run, ball-in-hand, just before the break. What can they muster. 35 min: Another loose pass in the Uruguayan backline move - they haven\u2019t quite managed to have their passes stick today. Los Teros claim an obstruction as Slipper knocks over a player on a kick and chase, but the referee\u2019s having none of it. The prop\u2019s entitled to hold his ground, I guess. 33 min: Australia now getting some momentum together as Beale again hits a great hole, off a fine line. Is it the Indigenous jersey that\u2019s giving him an extra lift? He\u2019s definitely looking in fine fettle today. He finds Petaia, and then picks up the return ball. But it\u2019s a poor lineout - the jumper misses it entirely, and they give up the attacking opportunity. 30 min: Australia fail to find touch from a penalty kick to the sideline, and Uruguay have the chance, ball in hand. But they\u2019ve coughed it up, so it\u2019s the Wallabies on the offensive. It was Hooper with the steal, it may have been forward the pass of, I\u2019d like to see that again. But they spin it out the back, Beale with hard, straight running, he offloads to Petaia, and the youngster finds his centre backing up inside. Try time. And it\u2019s a miss from Leali\u2019ifano. Very gettable, that. 27 min: It\u2019s a penalty against Australia, Beale catching his opponent marginally high, and Uruguay kick to the line. Gee, they\u2019ve given up some penalties so far. Is this ill discipline? Laziness? You don\u2019t imagine Michael Cheika will be enjoying this. Uruguay look for a chip and chase, but White cleans up in the air. And now we\u2019ve a second yellow card! It\u2019s Salakaia-Loto who gets a ten-minute spell on the sideline. Four high tackles - and fair play the French referee: Coleman\u2019s might have been marginal, but no mistaking a hit direct to the head from the Wallabies backrower. 26 min: Coleman returns - so Australia finish the yellow card period with a net +7 points differential. Call that experience perhaps - Uruguay really needed to make that count. They\u2019re back in the Australian half though, and it\u2019s Freitas again with a dangerous run. Hasn\u2019t he looked lively, early on. 24 min: Finally a touch for Petaia, as Australia hit wide! He carries well and takes the contact of two or three bodies, good post-contact metres from the teenager. Australia look to flick right - and who\u2019s on the end of it! It\u2019s a popped pass from the fullback Beale midfield, and the left winger has come hunting - and scores his first ever Wallabies try! No mistake from in front from Leali\u2019ifano with the conversion. Extras added. 22 min: But it\u2019s a great second shove from the Uruguayan pack and they turn it over! They play back and clear their lines - a nice thumping kick back to halfway. Danger averted. 20 min: Australia almost lose it from the seven-man scrum, before White pounces on a loose ball. Australia very lucky to get another scrum feed here - what was the infringement? Hooper was isolated and it appeared Uruguay were standing over it fairly. 19 min: We reset the scrum - again, valuable minutes being lost for Uruguay\u2019s one-man advantage. We\u2019re nearly a quarter of the match gone, and I don\u2019t think the youngster debutant Petaia has even had a touch! Get it wide, lads. 18 min: A decent bust from White off the lineout win, before Kuridrani gets some metres. Hooper gets the hand-off and charges for the line - has he grounded it! We go upstairs to double check. No clear view - we come back for a 5m scrum feed. 16 min: Beale with a chip and chase, but it just evades the fullback for the regather. Uruguay with the box kick, Haylett-Petty gathers well, and it\u2019s a penalty to Australia. Again, they take their time before kicking to touch. 15 min: So, Australia are down to 14 for ten minutes. What can Uruguay make from the advantage? We set for an Australia scrum feed - expected the Wallabies to \u201cmanage the clock\u201d wisely while they\u2019re down a body. 13 min: We stop for another TMO. Adam Coleman is given a yellow card! An interesting discussion - the TMO explicitly said on three occasions \u201cfirst contact with the shoulder\u201d but referee Raynal has told the Wallabies second rower he has to go for contact on the neck. A tough one? Or a good reminder of the rules? First points, Uruguay! They will be happy with that - but perhaps also disappointed they could get the try? Still, a bright start. 11 min: A flying Nicolas Freitas hits the line at pace, and he bundles down just a metre short of the line! Hooper grabs him, but it\u2019s a touch high. There\u2019s a lost ball shortly after, so Los Teros settle for a penalty advantage and point to the sticks. 9 min: Infringements from Australia, and Uruguay now set for a 5m lineout. Pockets of support around the arena get very excited - could this be a first try against Australia? We set for a scrum, 5m out. Uruguay with the feed. Great opportunity this. 7 min: Ball dropped! Coleman with a spill from the kickoff, Uruguay with ball in hand 30m out from Australia\u2019s line. What can they come up with? 5 min: Absolutely huge tackle from Manuel Diana! There was a loose ball Australia were just metres from the line and Tevita Kuridrani was stopped in full flight. But they recycle and swing wide, and the South Americans are caught with bodies short out wide. Haylett-Petty into the corner for the first points. And a curling effort from Leali\u2019ifano that comes back nicely and inside the posts, two points added. 3 min: Costly error here though from Uruguay, with a knock on from the lineout. We settle for our first scrum, Australia\u2019s feed around 35m out. And they earn a penalty at the scrum. Toomua punts for the line and they set up for the offensive lineout. 2 min: An early driving maul for Australia before Nic White gets his troops moving. But it\u2019s Manuel Ardao who earns the first penalty of the day as he gets the breakdown turnover with Coleman isolated. 1 min: And it\u2019s the boot of Christian Leali\u2019ifano that gets us underway! Uruguay take well and clear into touch around the halfway line. Perfect conditions in Oita, let\u2019s hope the handling matches. And now it\u2019s anthems - and just quietly - what an absolute banger that is from Uruguay. If you thought Brazil had a lively number do yourself a favour and get on this. And now the by comparisons mundane Australian ditty. Huge participation from the crowd, there could be a few Wallabies fans in the house tonight. So, our players are ready to head out onto the pristine Oita pitch. Australia, as mentioned, emphasising the green in the green &amp; gold, with this stunning Indigenous-patterned jersey, and the Uruguayans springing for a slightly more subdued white jersey. Imagine the laundry bill post-game. Our referee today is Mathieu Raynal. Hurrah. At least it\u2019s not Romain Poite I guess. And a reminder that we\u2019ve a huge triple header of rugby in store today. After Australia v Uruguay you can hop into your outrigger and sail across the Rio de La Plata to Buenos Aires, where the festivities will no doubt be building long into the South American evening: Argentina v England. Do you reckon there\u2019s any history between these two nations? How up for this will Mario Ledesma\u2019s men be - they\u2019ve said pre-game it\u2019s their \u201cWorld Cup final\u201d, have Argentina. Then, for dessert - Japan v Samoa. The host nation will be looking to win four consecutive World Cup games for the first time ever, and build on their remarkable run after their stunning upset of Ireland. But, without further ado - here\u2019s the teamlists: As mentioned, Jordan Petaia is the new name on the wing, while Leali\u2019ifano and Toomua have a chance to solidify their halves partnership. No O\u2019Connor so Samu Kerevi is drafted back onto the bench, while it\u2019s a new-look front row. Australia: (15-1) 15 Kurtley Beale, 14 Dane Haylett-Petty, 13 Tevita Kuridrani, 12 Matt To\u2019omua, 11 Jordan Petaia, 10 Christian Leali\u2019ifano, 9 Nicholas White, 8 Jack Dempsey, 7 Michael Hooper (c), 6 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 5 Adam Coleman, 4 Rob Simmons, 3 Allan Alaalatoa, 2 Folau Fainga\u2019a, 1 James Slipper. Bench: 16 Jordan Uelese, 17 Sekope Kepu, 18 Taniela Tupou, 19 Rory Arnold, 20 David Pocock, 21 Will Genia, 22 Samu Kerevi, 23 Adam Ashley-Cooper. For Uruguay - there\u2019s youth in plenty, with 12 players listed under 25. Great strategy, for mine - you can\u2019t fear what you don\u2019t know. The folly/bravery of youth and all that - like a young Michael Owen striding up for penalty number one at the 1998 World Cup. Why not. Uruguay: (15-1) 15 Rodrigo Silva, 14 Federico Favaro, 13 Tomas Inciarte, 12 Andres Vilaseca (c), 11 Nicolas Freitas, 10 Felipe Berchesi, 9 Agustin Ormaechea, 8 Manuel Diana, 7 Juan Diego Ormaechea, 6 Manuel Ardao, 5 Manuel Leindekar, 4 Franco Lamanna, 3 Diego Arbelo, 2 German Kessler, 1 Juan Echeverria. Bench: 6 Guillermo Pujadas, 17 Joaquin Jaunsolo, 18 Juan Pedro Rombys, 19 Ignacio Dotti, 20 Juan Manuel Gaminara, 21 Santiago Arata, 22 Felipe Etcheverry, 23 Agustin Della Corte. All the talk from out of Australia is about the exciting youngster, Jordan Petaia, who\u2019s set to become the youngest ever Wallaby to appear at a World Cup - breaking Joe Roff\u2019s record, as he lines up at wing, aged just 19 years old. There\u2019s something else making its debut in this match that\u2019s pretty exciting, just quietly. Check out this little number: A small development from inside the Australian camp that may make the Uruguayan cause marginally easier - news that James O\u2019Connor has been scratched out of the clash, due to injury: So. David vs Goliath. How do Uruguay plot another World Cup miracle? For a side that qualified via playoff games v Chile, Peru and Brazil, facing one of just four nations that have won the whole tournament must be something else completely. \u201cPlaying Australia is motivation enough - we don\u2019t get to play tier one nations except for at the World Cup. Execute our game plan, play with tempo and rhythm. We need to think about us, and our play, not them.\u201d That\u2019s the word from the Uruguayan camp pre-game. They won\u2019t have the skill level of Australia - many of these players are of course amateurs; but you\u2019ll be sure they\u2019ll have hearts beating out of their chests. Just cast your mind back to the celebrations post-game after that historic win over Fiji. Hi all! A good morning/evening/post-prandial recline to you, in what ever circumstances this blog currently finds you around the world. It\u2019s just past 2.30pm in Sydney and 1.30am in Uruguay so I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s some brave Los Teros fans channelling the Charruas fighting spirit and staying up all doors for this one. Are you having a massive party, draped with sky blue and white streamers, with miscellaneous party meats on the BBQ? Let us know! Email or tweet me to join the discussion today - I want to hear your predictions, insights, premonitions. Australia v Uruguay. One of the iconic battles. If we\u2019re talking football c. 2005 that is. When it comes to the Gilbert, though, these two sides boast just one meeting - and as per now, this came during the pool stage of the 2015 World Cup. That one finished 65-3. This one may not finish much closer. Being complacent about Uruguay at rugby in 2019 comes with a giant sized asterisk though. Just ask John McKee and the staff of Fiji, whose tournament hopes now lie in tatters, after the \u201cGrab-and-Smashi of Kaimashi\u201d, where the unfancied Los Teros emerged 30-27 victors. In theory, lighting doesn\u2019t strike twice, and you could argue that Australia have too much talent across the park for Uruguay to even come close. But after one of the all-time Rugby World Cup upsets, don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a bit more to Los Teros than people have given them credit.",

      "bodyText": "From snowflakes to Spartans and saboteurs to surrender, the vocabulary of Brexit is growing so fast and proving so slippery that the public risks losing track of what people are talking about, a leading language professor has said. With the prime minister revelling in the use of military metaphors such as \u201csurrender\u201d to deride parliament\u2019s opposition to a hard Brexit and Church of England bishops denouncing the \u201cunacceptable\u201d tone of political debate, Tony Thorne, a visiting linguistics consultant at King\u2019s College London, is calling for help to build a public glossary of Brexitspeak and \u201cthe toxic terminology of populism\u201d. He has already gathered more than 200 terms that chart how political language has bloomed in recent years to close what academics call \u201clexical gaps\u201d, as older terms were found wanting to describe a shattered political landscape, creating an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD. \u201cPeople ought to familiarise themselves otherwise they risk being bamboozled and duped,\u201d says Thorne, a specialist in slang and jargon who also advises the police and courts on gang communication. \u201cFor more than a year I have been tracking the language of Brexit and populism we have developed on social media and in the mainstream media to talk about these things. A lot of the language is designed to trigger [emotions] rather than elucidate.\u201d In the same way as business language fell in line with increasingly complex corporate practices in the 80s and 90s, and the vocabulary around technology flowered alongside online culture in the 00s, there has been an eruption in English political coinages in the years after the Brexit vote, says Thorne. The vocabulary is often \u201cskunked\u201d or twisted, so it becomes hard to pin down, sometimes usefully so for its users. On the left, \u201ccentrist dad\u201d, something many people call themselves, can also be a pejorative term; \u201cmagic grandpa\u201d is used to describe Jeremy Corbyn by both fans and detractors; and a \u201cnormie\u201d is someone who can be found on both the left and the right, who wrongly accepts social standards and mainstream media. The right tends to have the wider lexicon, says Thorne. Remain supporters are variously identified by opponents as \u201canywheres\u201d and \u201cremainiacs\u201d engaged in \u201c\u201cremoanathons\u201d. There are dozens of pejorative nouns including \u201csoyboy\u201d, \u201clibtard\u201d, \u201csnowflake\u201d, \u201ccrybaby\u201d, \u201celite\u201d and \u201cestablishment\u201d. Rarely used terms have gained increasing currency to describe new tactics of argument, Thorne says. There is \u201cwhataboutery\u201d (rebutting an attack only by accusing an opponent of hypocrisy), \u201cbothsidesism\u201d (false balance in political debate) and \u201castroturfing\u201d (pretending a campaign has grassroots support). Boris Johnson has refused to back down over his use of military metaphors, including \u201csurrender\u201d. He jokingly asked a crowd at the Conservative party conference this week: \u201cAm I fighting a losing battle to use these military metaphors? Or should I stick to my guns?\u201d Last month Johnson described as \u201chumbug\u201d calls from Labour MPs to moderate his language in the light of the murder of their colleague Jo Cox in 2016, and has been criticised for talking of \u201ca terrible kind of collaboration\u201d between opponents of Brexit and EU states. All the main UK political parties this week signed a pledge to use moderate language. It urged leaders to \u201cweigh their words carefully, bearing in mind that there are stark divisions across the country on Brexit\u201d. \u201cThe right in the UK has only recently fired up the war metaphors, ramping up the notion of violent conflict and the associated notion already used against the EU of uniting against an \u2018enemy\u2019,\u201d says Thorne. \u201cNow it\u2019s a little different \u2013 the enemy is here at home and is anyone who disagrees. The left\u2019s vocabulary is more varied mixing jokey derision \u2013 melt [moderates], unicorn [impossible dream] \u2013 with more savage descriptions such as pathocracy [leadership by people with personality disorders].\u201d Thorne has identified confusing \u201csemantic clustering\u201d around contentious words such as \u201ccollusion\u201d, which has been used on both sides of the debate. Downing Street described the drafting of the Benn act opposing a no-deal Brexit as collusion, while the same term was used to allege that Johnson\u2019s backers may profit financially from Britain crashing out of the EU. Given it is hard to keep up, some observers have suggested the new semantic flowering suggests politics is becoming untethered from reality. Steve Buckledee, the author of The Language of Brexit, a book about the language of the referendum campaign, says the elaborate and codified nature of the language being used more than three years on could be evidence that most of the population has tuned out. \u201cPerhaps Joe Public is fed up with it all,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the people who are still interested are having a private conversation among themselves which only they understand.\u201d Glossary Airfix patriotism \u2013 caricatured vision of our heroic past based on war comics and model aeroplanes.

      "body": "<p>Tesco, M&amp;S and several other UK supermarkets admit that they cannot guarantee that soya from deforested areas is not in their supply chain despite commitments to phase out its use, the Guardian has found.</p> <p>An investigation has revealed that Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and M&amp;S all buy products from UK farmers using animal feed that includes soya from Argentina. About 14% of Argentina\u2019s planted soya is in the north of the country, where deforestation has laid waste to huge areas of the Gran Chaco forest.</p> <p>Argentinian officials have confirmed to the Guardian that there is no traceability system for soya from deforested areas, which appears to be mixed with soya from other parts of the country before being sold on to the UK and other parts of the world. Pablo Cortese, from Senasa, Argentina\u2019s equivalent of the US Food and Drug Administration, said there was no demand from buyers for traceability: \u201cIf the big grain traders demanded it, the same way that citrus fruit buyers demand it, Argentina would have no choice but to comply. It\u2019s the buyer who imposes traceability always.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian visited the Gran Chaco and saw bulldozers at work. Huge soya plantations stretched between small leftover islands of forest. A zoning system put in place by the Argentinian government a few years ago does not appear to have slowed the rapid deforestation, as seen in the satellite images produced by <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/country/ARG?mainMap=eyJzaG93QW5hbHlzaXMiOmZhbHNlLCJoaWRlTGVnZW5kIjpmYWxzZSwic2hvd0Jhc2VtYXBzIjpmYWxzZX0%3D&amp;map=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%3D\">Global Forest Watch</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/05/soya-rise-wonder-bean-from-deforestation-to-your-plate\">Rise of the 'wonder bean': from deforestation to your plate | Bibi van der Zee, Anna Gross, Uki Go\u00f1i</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The local grain wholesalers buy soy from different farmers and regions and mix it in the same silos before they sell it to the larger grain trading companies. \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult to trace soya in Argentina,\u201d Cortese told the Guardian. \u201cSo it\u2019s impossible to say, \u2018This particular grain of soya came from this particular farm.\u2019\u201d The soy is then shipped out of private grain-exporting terminals in Argentina\u2019s Rosario and San Lorenzo ports, with a significant amount coming to the UK. UK farms using feed that includes this soya supply a number of supermarkets, including Tesco, M&amp;S, Asda and Morrisons.</p> <p>Other producers and retailers are also likely to find Argentinian soya in their supply chain. The figures vary, because soya is traded under different classifications (soybeans, soymeal, oilcake) but according to <a href=\"https://oec.world/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/gbr/show/2304/2017/\">MIT\u2019s data about 55% of</a> the UK\u2019s soybean meal comes from Argentina.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902uP43Ijqfq8X6/\" data-alt=\"The Gran Chaco is over-shadowed by the Amazon rainforest.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902uP43Ijqfq8X6/\">The Gran Chaco is over-shadowed by the Amazon rainforest.</a> </figure>  <p>UK retailers agree that there is a problem with soya traceability. Tesco said it has a detailed plan to <a href=\"https://www.tescoplc.com/blog/uk-zero-deforestation-soy-transition-plan/\">eliminate deforested soya</a> from its supply chain by 2025. Marks &amp; Spencer agreed that Argentinian soya is in the company\u2019s supply chain: it is working towards a 2020 goal of zero deforestation, and refers to the work of the Retailers\u2019 Soy Group and the UK Roundtable on Sustainable Soya.</p> <p>Asda is working towards sustainable soya sourcing by 2020 for its own-brand meat, fish and dairy products. It is also looking into its entire supply chain, with the aim of sourcing <a href=\"https://www.edie.net/news/7/Asda-commits-to-new-zero-deforestation-soy-policy/\">100% responsible soya by 2025</a> for its primary protein range, including fresh meat, fish and milk.

(<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/05/deforestation-chaco-companies-full-responses\">Full statements can be found here</a>.)</p> <p>But the problem is so extensive that many scientists and campaigners question whether voluntary initiatives will solve the problem. Soya is one of the global commodities most closely associated with deforestation, along with palm oil, beef, timber and paper, and it is the <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/the-story-of-soy\">second largest driver</a> of deforestation, according to WWF.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c6d04bfc9962bfa58e5341544b7fcaefe5c821e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c6d04bfc9962bfa58e5341544b7fcaefe5c821e/0_0_5472_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smoke from a fresh forest clearance in Gran Chaco, northern Argentina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoke from a fresh forest clearance in Gran Chaco, northern Argentina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wickens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Production in South America, in particular, has expanded from 3% of the world\u2019s soya in 1970 <a href=\"https://yearbook2018.trase.earth/chapter3/\">to 50% today</a>, according to extensive research by Trase, a supply-chain initiative run by the Stockholm Environment Institute and NGO Global Canopy. </p> <p>The destruction of tropical forests around the world <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/death-by-a-thousand-cuts-vast-expanse-rainforest-lost-in-2018\">continues to rise</a>, with more than 3.6m hectares (8.9m acres) destroyed in 2018.

The Chaco, which sprawls across Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, has largely gone beneath the radar. \u201cBoth the Cerrado and the Chaco have been given pitifully little attention to date compared with the Amazon, yet both biomes are more imperilled. In recent years the Cerrado has risen in prominence in great part because of a greater level of research and NGO attention in Brazil \u2026 By contrast the Chaco is mostly in Paraguay, Argentina and Bolivia, countries that have received a tiny fraction of the research and surveillance of Brazil,\u201d said Toby Gardner of Trase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d659c2548d07e9e774b8d2969cf5b6ac821b517\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d659c2548d07e9e774b8d2969cf5b6ac821b517/0_184_5596_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deforestation and soya in the Chaco forest in Salta province, Argentina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deforestation and soya in the Chaco forest in Salta province, Argentina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicol\u00e1s Villalobos/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Argentina far outstrips the UK\u2019s and Europe\u2019s other suppliers when it comes to soya bean meal, the processed soya that is fed to farm animals.

      "bodyText": "Tesco, M&amp;S and several other UK supermarkets admit that they cannot guarantee that soya from deforested areas is not in their supply chain despite commitments to phase out its use, the Guardian has found. An investigation has revealed that Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and M&amp;S all buy products from UK farmers using animal feed that includes soya from Argentina. About 14% of Argentina\u2019s planted soya is in the north of the country, where deforestation has laid waste to huge areas of the Gran Chaco forest. Argentinian officials have confirmed to the Guardian that there is no traceability system for soya from deforested areas, which appears to be mixed with soya from other parts of the country before being sold on to the UK and other parts of the world. Pablo Cortese, from Senasa, Argentina\u2019s equivalent of the US Food and Drug Administration, said there was no demand from buyers for traceability: \u201cIf the big grain traders demanded it, the same way that citrus fruit buyers demand it, Argentina would have no choice but to comply. It\u2019s the buyer who imposes traceability always.\u201d The Guardian visited the Gran Chaco and saw bulldozers at work. Huge soya plantations stretched between small leftover islands of forest. A zoning system put in place by the Argentinian government a few years ago does not appear to have slowed the rapid deforestation, as seen in the satellite images produced by Global Forest Watch. The local grain wholesalers buy soy from different farmers and regions and mix it in the same silos before they sell it to the larger grain trading companies. \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult to trace soya in Argentina,\u201d Cortese told the Guardian. \u201cSo it\u2019s impossible to say, \u2018This particular grain of soya came from this particular farm.\u2019\u201d The soy is then shipped out of private grain-exporting terminals in Argentina\u2019s Rosario and San Lorenzo ports, with a significant amount coming to the UK. UK farms using feed that includes this soya supply a number of supermarkets, including Tesco, M&amp;S, Asda and Morrisons. Other producers and retailers are also likely to find Argentinian soya in their supply chain. The figures vary, because soya is traded under different classifications (soybeans, soymeal, oilcake) but according to MIT\u2019s data about 55% of the UK\u2019s soybean meal comes from Argentina. UK retailers agree that there is a problem with soya traceability. Tesco said it has a detailed plan to eliminate deforested soya from its supply chain by 2025. Marks &amp; Spencer agreed that Argentinian soya is in the company\u2019s supply chain: it is working towards a 2020 goal of zero deforestation, and refers to the work of the Retailers\u2019 Soy Group and the UK Roundtable on Sustainable Soya. Asda is working towards sustainable soya sourcing by 2020 for its own-brand meat, fish and dairy products. It is also looking into its entire supply chain, with the aim of sourcing 100% responsible soya by 2025 for its primary protein range, including fresh meat, fish and milk. Morrisons did not respond to Guardian queries. (Full statements can be found here.) But the problem is so extensive that many scientists and campaigners question whether voluntary initiatives will solve the problem. Soya is one of the global commodities most closely associated with deforestation, along with palm oil, beef, timber and paper, and it is the second largest driver of deforestation, according to WWF. Production in South America, in particular, has expanded from 3% of the world\u2019s soya in 1970 to 50% today, according to extensive research by Trase, a supply-chain initiative run by the Stockholm Environment Institute and NGO Global Canopy. The destruction of tropical forests around the world continues to rise, with more than 3.6m hectares (8.9m acres) destroyed in 2018. Recent science has revealed just how critical a role forests will play if the world is to have any hope of slowing climate change. So far most attention has been fixed on the Amazon and, to a lesser extent, the Cerrado forests in Brazil. The Chaco, which sprawls across Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, has largely gone beneath the radar. \u201cBoth the Cerrado and the Chaco have been given pitifully little attention to date compared with the Amazon, yet both biomes are more imperilled. In recent years the Cerrado has risen in prominence in great part because of a greater level of research and NGO attention in Brazil \u2026 By contrast the Chaco is mostly in Paraguay, Argentina and Bolivia, countries that have received a tiny fraction of the research and surveillance of Brazil,\u201d said Toby Gardner of Trase. Argentina far outstrips the UK\u2019s and Europe\u2019s other suppliers when it comes to soya bean meal, the processed soya that is fed to farm animals. The UK imports 55% of its soya bean meal from Argentina, Italy imports 80%, and Spain 74%, according to MIT\u2019s Observatory for Economic Complexity. Europe as a whole imports about half of its processed soya bean from Argentina alone. The country is also the world\u2019s leading soya bean meal exporter, responsible for 40% of the planet\u2019s total soya bean meal trade. In the UK \u2013 one of a number of signatories to the Amsterdam declaration on deforestation \u2013 retailers and NGOs have been leading the call for solutions. A meeting in March 2018 brought together 60 representatives from companies like Tesco and Cargill, and led to the formation of the Roundtable on Sustainable Soya, which is investigating ways to achieve a mass-market move to sustainable soya. Some NGOs, investors and consumer groups have called for an extension of the \u201cAmazon soya moratorium\u201d to other biomes in South America, including the Gran Chaco. The same people argue that the moratorium needs to be extended because in its current form it has simply pushed deforestation to other regions \u2013 like the Chaco. One possible route in Europe and the UK would be new regulations that require all companies of a certain size to file an annual report on the work they\u2019ve done to clear deforestation \u2013 and other issues \u2013 from their supply chains. France already has a similar law, put in place in 2017. ClientEarth, the Forest Coalition and the Greener UK coalition have been leading calls for such a requirement to be included in the current environment law. ClientEarth is also among a number of organisations pushing the EU to look at similar regulation to fulfil the aims set by the deforestation communication published in July.

They shouldn\u2019t be there. The forest they are clearing is a government-proposed protected corridor for wildlife, deep in the heart of the Chaco forest. Although recent reporting on deforestation has focused heavily on the Amazon, the fact is that the other ancient forests of South America \u2013 and elsewhere in the world \u2013 are disappearing too.</p> <p>These trees are probably falling to make way for a crop sometimes known as the \u201cwonder bean\u201d or even the \u201cCinderella bean\u201d: soya. As the plane carries on, the huge soya fields that now patchwork this area unfold beneath us, small strips of forest still clinging on around their margins.</p> <p>Crushing this small creamy bean releases both oil and a soya meal that is high in protein: it is one of a tiny group of commodities known as oilseeds. In the early part of the 20th century, the realisation by a group of determined US farmers and scientists that this cheap protein could feed farm animals turned the bean into one of the world\u2019s most important crops, and the fuel for a huge expansion in the global production and consumption of meat.</p> <p>The discovery of a stable, cheap source of protein might have been a miracle for farmers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2017-11/WWF_AppetiteForDestruction_Full_Report_Web_0.pdf\">75% of the world\u2019s soya</a> and maize is now fed to farm animals \u2013 but this monoculture is spreading over huge expanses of the Americas, and wiping out forests, wilderness and species as it goes.

One of Britain\u2019s largest feed manufacturers has deliveries in this shipment, as do a host of smaller companies. </p> <p>This is where the seeds of today\u2019s giant global soya trade were sown, just over a century ago. Before that soya beans had been grown and used only in Manchuria and China but in 1907, <a href=\"http://www.soyinfocenter.com/HSS/soybean_crushing3.php\">400-500 tonnes of soya beans</a> from Hankow, China, were sold to an oilseed crusher in this port of Liverpool, who turned it into soya oil and soya meal, both of which immediately found hungry markets. The oil was used in paints, in soaps, in food and, as the first world war began, as a raw material for nitroglycerine explosives. The meal, meanwhile, was a useful new protein to add to the mixed feeds given to dairy cattle. After a few failed enterprises and scandals, a group of determined US farmers, businessmen and scientists set about working out the most efficient and safe ways to process it: the \u201cwonder bean\u201d was born, and by the 1940s the US had become the world\u2019s leading soya producer.</p> <p>The UK and EU don\u2019t grow much soya and so the EU now imports about <a href=\"https://resourcetrade.earth/data?year=2016&amp;importer=97&amp;category=625&amp;units=weight\">15m tonnes</a> of un-ground soya beans, and about 19m tonnes of crushed meal, while in 2017 <a href=\"https://resourcetrade.earth/data?year=2017&amp;importer=826&amp;category=625&amp;units=weight\">the UK alone imported</a> 2m tonnes of oilcake. The biggest importer by far however is China, the one-time home of soy. In 2017 China imported a breathtaking <a href=\"https://resourcetrade.earth/data?year=2017&amp;importer=156&amp;category=87&amp;units=weight\">9</a><a href=\"https://resourcetrade.earth/data?year=2017&amp;importer=156&amp;category=87&amp;units=weight\">6m tonnes of soya beans</a>.

Huge metal machines grind maize, wheat and soya, creating a dull and persistent hum across the estate, while others mix them together in varying ratios, and splutter them out into white sacks.</p> <p>Today world compound feed production is estimated to be <a href=\"https://ifif.org/global-feed/statistics/\">1bn tonnes</a> a year, generating an estimated turnover of more than \u00a3300bn. And the market is set to expand further. NWF Agriculture is one of the UK\u2019s feed-producing majors, <a href=\"https://www.nwfagriculture.co.uk/dairy/\">feeding one in six cows</a>, and generating revenues <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/NWF_Group_plc_Annual_Report_and_Accounts_2018.pdf\">in 2018 of \u00a3169m</a>. </p> <p>Modern farm animals have moved on from slops, the insects they picked out of the ground, the grass on a marginal bit of land, supplemented with bits of feed here and there. Like many modern humans they eat an entirely industrialised diet, brought to the farmer in sacks. But although the form of the diet has changed the building bricks have not: they still need protein, in whatever form it takes.</p> <p>So as our global consumption of protein, in the shape of meat, rises, the amount of protein needed to produce that meat rises correspondingly. A major source of protein for those feeds, for many years, was meat and bonemeal, waste products for farmers and slaughterhouses, but in 1988 they were banned in the UK after BSE broke out and was then connected to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans \u2013 a ban that has been replicated in many other countries. And so soya, the cheapest alternative source of protein, is now absolutely critical to the world\u2019s farmers.</p> <p>Modern high-protein grain feed, combined with intense breeding work over the last 50 years, has supercharged animal growth and fattening. An employee at one feed company tells the Guardian that modern feed can get chickens to grow full-size in 40 days rather than the natural 4.5 months. \u201cNow they get so fat, so quickly, they struggle to stand up,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"be7c192b2ed4caf0b7d44812a211f7fe84515687\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be7c192b2ed4caf0b7d44812a211f7fe84515687/0_344_5256_3153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rotary milking parlour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rotary milking parlour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wayne Hutchinson/UIG/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>5.

The Guardian spoke to one dairy farmer who had been farming his whole life and who buys his feed from NWF Agriculture, and sells his milk to Cadbury (\u201ca very good contract\u201d). He said: \u201cOur feed is analysed for quality and to make sure it\u2019s good value. We tend to stay with certain products for a long time. That\u2019s our business ethos, we haven\u2019t been chopping and changing. We wouldn\u2019t use it if we weren\u2019t happy. We think it\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <p>Choices are fairly stark. Standard feed costs about \u00a3250 a tonne; organic feed, with certified soya, is closer to \u00a3460 per tonne. Raising cattle on grass doesn\u2019t mean you save money: Anna Blumfield raises Pasture for Life-certified cows on Deersbrook farm, and points out that because the animals take 24-26 months to get ready, rather than the 18 months of a high-protein fed cow, and because they rent the pasture which feeds the animals, there is no saving on feed. </p> <p> \u201cWe try to avoid soy as much as possible,\u201d says Daniel Hoeberichts of Brambletye Orchard farm, \u201cbut chickens need some form of protein.\u201d His biodynamic chickens roam a Sussex orchard and get a third of their diet from whatever they find in the soil: earthworms and insects, with home-made, carefully balanced feeds of organic oats, wheat and soya to make up the rest. </p> <p>He is well aware of the problems of soya and its sources, \u201cbut the problem is that the animals do need protein, and soya is the best source for that\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really raise pigs or poultry on forage-based diets,\u201d says Gillian Butler, <a href=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/staff/profile/gillianbutler.html#background\">senior lecturer</a> in the Nafferton Ecological Farming Group at Newcastle University, \u201cand no single commodity can totally replace soya \u2013 all alternative feeds have some limitations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4eb66a7d0b932569ea53fd5b6afa49c8809bcba8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb66a7d0b932569ea53fd5b6afa49c8809bcba8/0_0_4902_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cartons of milk on sale in a UK supermarket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cartons of milk on sale in a UK supermarket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>6.

Meat (chicken, pork, beef, plus plenty of other of delicacies). Milk. Eggs. Cheese. Sometimes products have dairy in them that you\u2019ve forgotten about. Ready meals. Salad dressings. Puddings. Biscuits. Bars of chocolate.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a secret in the supermarket industry that soya is linked to deforestation and pretty much every player along the chain has made some sort of commitment to do something about it. Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer are at the forefront of these efforts, working with the <a href=\"http://www.efeca.com/launch-uk-roundtable-sustainable-soya/\">Roundtable on Sustainable Soya</a> that was set up by the UK government last year. When we contacted them to ask about the likely deforestation in their supply chain, both came back with detailed plans and specific targets. </p> <p>Most of them are starting with a credit system that finances farmers who are developing sustainable soya set-ups. Tesco\u2019s spokesman pointed out to us that, yes, \u201cthere is a problem with soya traceability in general\u201d, so they are supporting the credit system while they work simultaneously on the traceability problem. Their next step will be to buy from farms that have been certified deforestation-free, and then, ideally, certified regions.</p> <p>But it could be argued that the supermarket model of buying big and selling cheap has played its own part in this problem. In order to sell shoppers the famous \u00a32 chickens, margins have to be shaved to a cigarette-paper slenderness. When cheapness is the main consideration, the cheapest source of protein will be the only possibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"11a25b5adffaa7e4797c09eb6b851769b5dec440\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11a25b5adffaa7e4797c09eb6b851769b5dec440/344_629_5624_3375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chocolate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chocolate \u2013 just one of so many products which may have deforestation in its supply chain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Andreas/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>7.

You\u2019re peeling open the bar of chocolate; the cheese has been heaped, deliciously, onto the cracker; the roast chicken arrives on a mouth-watering mound of roast potatoes and vegetables, all, perhaps, accompanied with a shadowing, at the back of your mind, of guilt. After all, we\u2019re the people who buy this stuff. </p> <p>Are our politicians doing anything? We currently spend <a href=\"https://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/department/DEFRA\">hundreds of millions</a> of pounds on combating deforestation overseas as part of our environment commitments. It seems ironic that we would be spending this money to combat deforestation in some parts of the world while what we eat is fuelling it in others. Would it not be cost-effective to use the money to deal with that problem?</p> <p>When the Guardian asked Defra whether they were aware of the problem and whether they were engaging with the Argentinian government on the subject, we were referred to the Department of International Trade. DIT told us: \u201cWe share concerns about the increase in deforestation across South America. The key to tackling this is to work in partnership with countries in the region. The UK is working to protect forests in Argentina through our International Climate Finance and Latam Forest Biodiversity and Resilience projects.\u201d The latter is an education and awareness programme that has spent \u00a3900,000 in Argentina, according to DIT.</p> <p>Is there anything that we, as consumers, can actually do? Dr Chris West, who works on soya and supply chains for the Stockholm Environment Institute at the University of York, suggests the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>Where soya-based products are used, look for certified standards such as ProTerra or RTRS that \u201cguarantee\u201d the soya is deforestation free.</p></li> <li><p>Given the lack of information on what animals are fed, we should cut down on meat consumption. This is the only way to decrease soya-dependence and reduce pressure on these environments.</p></li> <li><p>Review the policies and commitments of retail outlets and manufacturers. Do they have strong statements on zero-deforestation, and evidence of working towards these targets? Do they have stringent requirements on their supply chain?</p></li> <li><p>Support NGOs working with \u2013 or lobbying \u2013 private and public sector organisations to change practice.</p></li> </ul> <p>The government has helped to set up the UK\u2019s Roundtable on Sustainable Soya, as well as the Global Resources Initiative, two industrial forums looking for answers to problems that the far-sighted business leaders understand are only going to get worse. At the moment they\u2019re considering voluntary initiatives, but Jonathan Gorman of Efeca, the organisation supporting the two forums, says that there is awareness that that may not be enough, that industry is aware that regulation may have to be on the table, and that they need to move together. \u201cThere is huge energy to crack on \u2026 There comes a time when you can\u2019t just clean up your own act.\u201d</p> <p>Calls for some kind of due diligence law, similar to <a href=\"https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2017/3/27/2017-399/jo/texte\">France\u2019s of 2017</a> <em>,</em> are gathering strength. Our own modern slavery act compels all companies over a certain size to state what they are doing to check their supply chain for slavery; a due diligence law might do the same for deforestation, or for other environmental and human rights issues.</p> <p>Soya, after all, is just one small component in the vast four-dimensional puzzle of international trade that puts food on our plates at one end, and leads back to falling trees, or vanishing species, or polluted water at the other. Nations have been trading goods for as far back as there have been nations, but the complexity and length of those supply chains has multiplied exponentially.</p> <p>And yet complexity is not the problem. With the help of computers that we have designed we are more than capable of breaking down and apart those supply chains, of focusing in on the weak links and working out where the damage is being done. What is missing is the information. Companies and countries may be holding back for reasons of commercial sensitivity \u2013 or for other reasons. But without transparency, throughout these long interwoven chains, without co-operation, commercial interests will trump the environmental issues. And we will lose our forests. </p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/05/tesco-m-and-s-supermarkets-likely-to-have-soya-linked-to-deforestation-supply-chains\">Tesco and M&amp;S likely to have soya linked to deforestation in supply chains</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/05/screaming-hairy-armadillo-the-forest-the-world-forgot-gran-chaco\">Home to the screaming hairy armadillo: the forest the world forgot</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "1. The Chaco forest Skimming low over the forest with the passenger door removed, the pilot is tilting his single-propeller Cessna 172 so that the photographer can lean out of the tiny cockpit for a clear shot. On the ground below, giant yellow bulldozers are moving in pairs, hauling thick chains through the no-longer impenetrable forest, knocking down trees like tenpins in a bowling alley. The sight of the Greenpeace plane looping back for another pass over their heads sends the bulldozer crews scurrying for cover under the remaining trees. They are right to hide. They shouldn\u2019t be there. The forest they are clearing is a government-proposed protected corridor for wildlife, deep in the heart of the Chaco forest. Although recent reporting on deforestation has focused heavily on the Amazon, the fact is that the other ancient forests of South America \u2013 and elsewhere in the world \u2013 are disappearing too. These trees are probably falling to make way for a crop sometimes known as the \u201cwonder bean\u201d or even the \u201cCinderella bean\u201d: soya. As the plane carries on, the huge soya fields that now patchwork this area unfold beneath us, small strips of forest still clinging on around their margins. Crushing this small creamy bean releases both oil and a soya meal that is high in protein: it is one of a tiny group of commodities known as oilseeds. In the early part of the 20th century, the realisation by a group of determined US farmers and scientists that this cheap protein could feed farm animals turned the bean into one of the world\u2019s most important crops, and the fuel for a huge expansion in the global production and consumption of meat. The discovery of a stable, cheap source of protein might have been a miracle for farmers \u2013 75% of the world\u2019s soya and maize is now fed to farm animals \u2013 but this monoculture is spreading over huge expanses of the Americas, and wiping out forests, wilderness and species as it goes. Soya is one of the four main culprits for deforestation (along with beef, wood and palm oil) and biodiversity loss as farmers clear land to grow this profitable oilseed. Our huge consumption of soya is driving two of the worst environmental crises we face. Here, in the north of Argentina, one of the world\u2019s leading producers of soya, the results of its endless, restless expansion are evident. \u201cThe chains cut through more than just the vegetation,\u201d Noem\u00ed Cruz, a Greenpeace activist in the plane, yells over the roar of the propeller. \u201cAfter the bulldozers have gone you\u2019ll sometimes find the paw of a jaguar in the clearing.\u201d There are protections in place \u2013 but provincial authorities have found ways around them. As a result the deforestation rate in Argentina is one of the highest in the world. According to Nasa\u2019s Earth Observatory, 20% of the Gran Chaco\u2019s forest, 55,000 square miles \u2013 an area larger than England \u2013 was lost between 1985 and 2016. The huge clearings can be visualised in miniature in the time-lapse display on the University of Maryland\u2019s Global Forest Watch website. Where is this soya going? There aren\u2019t many people around the vast fields, but one grower said it would be taken south, to the port of Rosario. And then? To ports around the world, and from there to our farms. 2. The port in Argentina At the vast port of Rosario, nestled on the wide Paran\u00e1 river, 185 miles inland from the coastal capital Buenos Aires, grain arrives from all over the country, on barges, trains and trucks. \u201cThere are about 1,500 trucks arriving here daily at harvest time,\u201d says one of the truck drivers waiting to unload his cargo into a grain silo in the port terminal of the grain giant Cargill. Hundreds line up outside the individual port terminals of ADM, Bunge and Louis Dreyfus too (the four companies are collectively known as the ABCD of international grain trading). The vast majority of Argentina\u2019s grain exports are shipped through Rosario and its sister port San Lorenzo, just 18 miles up-river. But the lack of a public traceability system makes it practically impossible to determine where the soya is coming from. \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult to trace soya in Argentina,\u201d says Pablo Cortese, of Argentina\u2019s food and drug administration (Senasa). \u201cThe soya is first bought by local grain wholesalers, who not only buy the soya from different farmers but sometimes also from different regions. All that soya is mixed in their silos, making traceability impossible already at that first stage of the process. Then the port terminals receive trucks from a large number of different wholesalers. So it\u2019s impossible to say, \u2018This particular grain of soya came from this particular farm.\u2019\u201d However, Cortese believes that Argentina could introduce a soya traceability system. \u201cThe citrus fruit we export to Europe, for example \u2013 I can tell you exactly which particular farm in the province of Tucum\u00e1n any particular lemon or orange came from.\u201d He regrets that the same kind of traceability is not in place for soya, which represents more than 25% of Argentina\u2019s exports, but places the responsibility on Argentina\u2019s buyers. \u201cIf the big grain traders demanded it, the same way that citrus fruit buyers demand it, Argentina would have no choice but to comply. It\u2019s the buyer who imposes traceability always.\u201d Dreyfus, Cargill, ADM and Bunge all told the Guardian via email that they had been doing significant work to improve the traceability of their soya. (Full statements available here.) \u201cThe thing is that Argentina has been very behind with passing environmental controls,\u201d says Marina Engels of the Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS), who are working hard on sustainable soya in Argentina and globally. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been in economic crisis for so long, the environment has not been in our minds.\u201d The problem is that with its economy in perpetual flux, Argentina relies on soya for financial buoyancy. The commodity is the backbone of its economy. Combined, soya bean, soya meal and soya bean oil make up more than 25% of the country\u2019s exports. The export boom for commodities like soya bean helped Argentina\u2019s economy grow a staggering yearly average 7.7% between 2004-10, after its cataclysmic 2001-2002 economic crash. Argentina spent much of the windfall paying off debt, including the cancellation of its entire IMF debt in 2006. And with the current financial crisis, soya is a lifeline, an export that over the last 15 years has risen (with several ups and downs) from about 19.5m tonnes a year to more than 42m. 3. Liverpool docks A steady stream of buyers and their hauliers are queuing at the port of Liverpool after a bulk carrier holding Argentinian soya is given the green-light to berth and unload its cargo, having spent days out at anchor off the north Wales coast. One of Britain\u2019s largest feed manufacturers has deliveries in this shipment, as do a host of smaller companies. This is where the seeds of today\u2019s giant global soya trade were sown, just over a century ago. Before that soya beans had been grown and used only in Manchuria and China but in 1907, 400-500 tonnes of soya beans from Hankow, China, were sold to an oilseed crusher in this port of Liverpool, who turned it into soya oil and soya meal, both of which immediately found hungry markets. The oil was used in paints, in soaps, in food and, as the first world war began, as a raw material for nitroglycerine explosives. The meal, meanwhile, was a useful new protein to add to the mixed feeds given to dairy cattle. After a few failed enterprises and scandals, a group of determined US farmers, businessmen and scientists set about working out the most efficient and safe ways to process it: the \u201cwonder bean\u201d was born, and by the 1940s the US had become the world\u2019s leading soya producer. The UK and EU don\u2019t grow much soya and so the EU now imports about 15m tonnes of un-ground soya beans, and about 19m tonnes of crushed meal, while in 2017 the UK alone imported 2m tonnes of oilcake. The biggest importer by far however is China, the one-time home of soy. In 2017 China imported a breathtaking 96m tonnes of soya beans. For the exporters \u2013 America, Brazil and Argentina \u2013 soya is big business. 4. The feed manufacturers Imposing fences surround the feed plant belonging to NWF Agriculture, nestled in an industrial estate near Chester. Huge metal machines grind maize, wheat and soya, creating a dull and persistent hum across the estate, while others mix them together in varying ratios, and splutter them out into white sacks. Today world compound feed production is estimated to be 1bn tonnes a year, generating an estimated turnover of more than \u00a3300bn. And the market is set to expand further. NWF Agriculture is one of the UK\u2019s feed-producing majors, feeding one in six cows, and generating revenues in 2018 of \u00a3169m. Modern farm animals have moved on from slops, the insects they picked out of the ground, the grass on a marginal bit of land, supplemented with bits of feed here and there. Like many modern humans they eat an entirely industrialised diet, brought to the farmer in sacks. But although the form of the diet has changed the building bricks have not: they still need protein, in whatever form it takes. So as our global consumption of protein, in the shape of meat, rises, the amount of protein needed to produce that meat rises correspondingly. A major source of protein for those feeds, for many years, was meat and bonemeal, waste products for farmers and slaughterhouses, but in 1988 they were banned in the UK after BSE broke out and was then connected to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans \u2013 a ban that has been replicated in many other countries. And so soya, the cheapest alternative source of protein, is now absolutely critical to the world\u2019s farmers. Modern high-protein grain feed, combined with intense breeding work over the last 50 years, has supercharged animal growth and fattening. An employee at one feed company tells the Guardian that modern feed can get chickens to grow full-size in 40 days rather than the natural 4.5 months. \u201cNow they get so fat, so quickly, they struggle to stand up,\u201d he says. 5. The farms The farmers \u2013 most of them \u2013 are fully appreciative of modern feed. The Guardian spoke to one dairy farmer who had been farming his whole life and who buys his feed from NWF Agriculture, and sells his milk to Cadbury (\u201ca very good contract\u201d). He said: \u201cOur feed is analysed for quality and to make sure it\u2019s good value. We tend to stay with certain products for a long time. That\u2019s our business ethos, we haven\u2019t been chopping and changing. We wouldn\u2019t use it if we weren\u2019t happy. We think it\u2019s good.\u201d Choices are fairly stark. Standard feed costs about \u00a3250 a tonne; organic feed, with certified soya, is closer to \u00a3460 per tonne. Raising cattle on grass doesn\u2019t mean you save money: Anna Blumfield raises Pasture for Life-certified cows on Deersbrook farm, and points out that because the animals take 24-26 months to get ready, rather than the 18 months of a high-protein fed cow, and because they rent the pasture which feeds the animals, there is no saving on feed. \u201cWe try to avoid soy as much as possible,\u201d says Daniel Hoeberichts of Brambletye Orchard farm, \u201cbut chickens need some form of protein.\u201d His biodynamic chickens roam a Sussex orchard and get a third of their diet from whatever they find in the soil: earthworms and insects, with home-made, carefully balanced feeds of organic oats, wheat and soya to make up the rest. He is well aware of the problems of soya and its sources, \u201cbut the problem is that the animals do need protein, and soya is the best source for that\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t really raise pigs or poultry on forage-based diets,\u201d says Gillian Butler, senior lecturer in the Nafferton Ecological Farming Group at Newcastle University, \u201cand no single commodity can totally replace soya \u2013 all alternative feeds have some limitations.\u201d 6. The supermarkets It is hard to calculate just how widely soya is spread through the supply chain of our supermarket shelves. Meat (chicken, pork, beef, plus plenty of other of delicacies). Milk. Eggs. Cheese. Sometimes products have dairy in them that you\u2019ve forgotten about. Ready meals. Salad dressings. Puddings. Biscuits. Bars of chocolate. It\u2019s not a secret in the supermarket industry that soya is linked to deforestation and pretty much every player along the chain has made some sort of commitment to do something about it. Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer are at the forefront of these efforts, working with the Roundtable on Sustainable Soya that was set up by the UK government last year. When we contacted them to ask about the likely deforestation in their supply chain, both came back with detailed plans and specific targets. Most of them are starting with a credit system that finances farmers who are developing sustainable soya set-ups. Tesco\u2019s spokesman pointed out to us that, yes, \u201cthere is a problem with soya traceability in general\u201d, so they are supporting the credit system while they work simultaneously on the traceability problem. Their next step will be to buy from farms that have been certified deforestation-free, and then, ideally, certified regions. But it could be argued that the supermarket model of buying big and selling cheap has played its own part in this problem. In order to sell shoppers the famous \u00a32 chickens, margins have to be shaved to a cigarette-paper slenderness. When cheapness is the main consideration, the cheapest source of protein will be the only possibility. 7. Your plate So here it is. You\u2019re peeling open the bar of chocolate; the cheese has been heaped, deliciously, onto the cracker; the roast chicken arrives on a mouth-watering mound of roast potatoes and vegetables, all, perhaps, accompanied with a shadowing, at the back of your mind, of guilt. After all, we\u2019re the people who buy this stuff. Are our politicians doing anything? We currently spend hundreds of millions of pounds on combating deforestation overseas as part of our environment commitments. It seems ironic that we would be spending this money to combat deforestation in some parts of the world while what we eat is fuelling it in others. Would it not be cost-effective to use the money to deal with that problem? When the Guardian asked Defra whether they were aware of the problem and whether they were engaging with the Argentinian government on the subject, we were referred to the Department of International Trade. DIT told us: \u201cWe share concerns about the increase in deforestation across South America. The key to tackling this is to work in partnership with countries in the region. The UK is working to protect forests in Argentina through our International Climate Finance and Latam Forest Biodiversity and Resilience projects.\u201d The latter is an education and awareness programme that has spent \u00a3900,000 in Argentina, according to DIT. Is there anything that we, as consumers, can actually do? Dr Chris West, who works on soya and supply chains for the Stockholm Environment Institute at the University of York, suggests the following: Where soya-based products are used, look for certified standards such as ProTerra or RTRS that \u201cguarantee\u201d the soya is deforestation free. Given the lack of information on what animals are fed, we should cut down on meat consumption. This is the only way to decrease soya-dependence and reduce pressure on these environments. Review the policies and commitments of retail outlets and manufacturers. Do they have strong statements on zero-deforestation, and evidence of working towards these targets? Do they have stringent requirements on their supply chain? Support NGOs working with \u2013 or lobbying \u2013 private and public sector organisations to change practice. The government has helped to set up the UK\u2019s Roundtable on Sustainable Soya, as well as the Global Resources Initiative, two industrial forums looking for answers to problems that the far-sighted business leaders understand are only going to get worse. At the moment they\u2019re considering voluntary initiatives, but Jonathan Gorman of Efeca, the organisation supporting the two forums, says that there is awareness that that may not be enough, that industry is aware that regulation may have to be on the table, and that they need to move together. \u201cThere is huge energy to crack on \u2026 There comes a time when you can\u2019t just clean up your own act.\u201d Calls for some kind of due diligence law, similar to France\u2019s of 2017 , are gathering strength. Our own modern slavery act compels all companies over a certain size to state what they are doing to check their supply chain for slavery; a due diligence law might do the same for deforestation, or for other environmental and human rights issues. Soya, after all, is just one small component in the vast four-dimensional puzzle of international trade that puts food on our plates at one end, and leads back to falling trees, or vanishing species, or polluted water at the other. Nations have been trading goods for as far back as there have been nations, but the complexity and length of those supply chains has multiplied exponentially. And yet complexity is not the problem. With the help of computers that we have designed we are more than capable of breaking down and apart those supply chains, of focusing in on the weak links and working out where the damage is being done. What is missing is the information. Companies and countries may be holding back for reasons of commercial sensitivity \u2013 or for other reasons. But without transparency, throughout these long interwoven chains, without co-operation, commercial interests will trump the environmental issues. And we will lose our forests.

Each one becomes a prop for another hastily adopted role: pilot, priest, matador. He is a man of obscure dexterities - he can, for example, move the brim of his hat up and down with his eyebrows, using his ears as a fulcrum. He seems to favour the longest and the brightest (he can do more with these) although the scarf he turned up in today is short and sober, black with white polka dots. He seems perplexed by a wide scarf with a hole for your head (from A Cold Wall), and decides to wear it as a priestly vestment, staring heavenward while the photographer snaps.</p> <p>McCoy was born Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith in Dunoon, Scotland in 1943.

Joining a cast that included a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/30/bob-hoskins\" title=\"\">Bob Hoskins</a>, McCoy played a stuntman called \u201cSylveste McCoy, the Human Bomb\u201d, who put ferrets down his trousers and hammered nails up his nose.

In his early outings, he was a clownish Doctor \u2013 he played the spoons and did magic tricks \u2013 but over time McCoy and the writers decided to access something ambivalent in the character. \u201cIt went darker and more mysterious,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He was saddled with one unfortunate bit of wardrobe as the Doctor: a multicoloured pullover with question marks all over it. \u201cI thought it was overstated,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the producer wanted it.

Still, McCoy reckons his lifelong predilection for scarves may have helped him get the role. \u201cPeople always said to me: \u2018You\u2019d make a good Doctor!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018I might try this.\u2019\u201d He put himself forward when Peter Davison left in 1984, but the part had already gone to Colin Baker. Two years later, when Baker was pushed out, McCoy got his chance. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the show,\u201d he says. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen it for years, because I was always working in the theatre.\u201d One of the things he\u2019d missed was the acrimony surrounding his predecessor\u2019s departure. Baker declined to shoot the traditional regeneration scene for the new season, leaving McCoy to play both sides of the transformation. \u201cThey put me in his costume,\u201d he says, \u201cand they lost me for three days, \u2019cos he\u2019s a big fella.\u201d Under the hot lights of today\u2019s photoshoot, it becomes clear that McCoy was born to model scarves. Each one becomes a prop for another hastily adopted role: pilot, priest, matador. He is a man of obscure dexterities - he can, for example, move the brim of his hat up and down with his eyebrows, using his ears as a fulcrum. He seems to favour the longest and the brightest (he can do more with these) although the scarf he turned up in today is short and sober, black with white polka dots. He seems perplexed by a wide scarf with a hole for your head (from A Cold Wall), and decides to wear it as a priestly vestment, staring heavenward while the photographer snaps. McCoy was born Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith in Dunoon, Scotland in 1943. As a young man he moved to London and spent five unhappy years working in the City. \u201cI was terrible at it!\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, really bad.\u201d He was working in a theatre box office when he was discovered by the writer and performer Ken Campbell. \u201cHe said: \u2018\u2019Ere, d\u2019you want a job in my show?\u2019\u201d (The impersonation is eerily like the late Campbell.) \u201cI said yes. I always say yes, and then work out how to get out of it, but this time I couldn\u2019t. So I ended up becoming an actor.\u201d The Ken Campbell Roadshow was a rowdy mix of sketches, songs, jokes and gleeful vulgarity. Joining a cast that included a young Bob Hoskins, McCoy played a stuntman called \u201cSylveste McCoy, the Human Bomb\u201d, who put ferrets down his trousers and hammered nails up his nose. With the addition of an R, his stage name was born. In 1972, after touring the working men\u2019s clubs of Britain, the roadshow received an invitation to perform in Israel, where they alarmed and bewildered audiences for a week. \u201cThey thought they\u2019d booked the Glen Campbell Roadshow,\u201d says McCoy. \u201cThey eventually forgave us.\u201d McCoy spent a dozen years working in children\u2019s TV (Vision On, Jigsaw, Tiswas) and theatre before he got the call-up to star in Doctor Who in 1987 (Campbell was also up for the role, but deemed too scary). In his early outings, he was a clownish Doctor \u2013 he played the spoons and did magic tricks \u2013 but over time McCoy and the writers decided to access something ambivalent in the character. \u201cIt went darker and more mysterious,\u201d he says. He was saddled with one unfortunate bit of wardrobe as the Doctor: a multicoloured pullover with question marks all over it. \u201cI thought it was overstated,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the producer wanted it. I think his granny knitted them.\u201d The novelty jumper certainly undermined a lot of his darker scenes. \u201cIf we\u2019d done a fourth season I would have got rid of it, because by then I had the muscle.\u201d It was not to be: for a long period McCoy seemed destined to be best known as the final Doctor. \u201cI was the one that killed it off, yeah,\u201d he says. Yet after the successful resurrection of the franchise, McCoy\u2019s three-dimensional Doctor is now seen as something of a prototype for the 21st-century incarnations. These days he is as busy as ever, working in film, TV and theatre; he even lives on as the Doctor in a popular audio series. For the final shot of the day, McCoy drapes himself in every available scarf \u2013 a dozen or more. \u201cGo on, pile them on,\u201d he says, standing patiently while wrapped to the eyeballs, until he softly confesses that one of his knees is beginning to go. The scarves are removed. He is released. Four flights of stairs later, down in the street, McCoy waits for his ride home, looking impeccable in his own clothes \u2013 scarf, suit, braces, tie, cane \u2013 and not unlike his old incarnation. \u201cSomeone once asked me what advice I would give a new Doctor,\u201d he says, \u201cand I said: \u2018Don\u2019t wear what you really like to wear.\u2019 For years, I couldn\u2019t go out in a hat.\u201d A car stops at the lights, and a dog sitting in the passenger seat looks him up and down. \u201cHello!\u201d shouts McCoy, waving. The dog stares.",

      "bodyText": "Suits you sir? Maybe it doesn\u2019t any more. Sales of formal tailoring have taken a fresh dive as chinos and trainers replace suits and ties in the office. In a presentation to City analysts earlier this week, Marks &amp; Spencer, the UK\u2019s biggest menswear retailer, said it was cutting back its formalwear ranges and the space devoted to selling suits, pointing to a market-wide 7% fall in suit sales. Sales of ties are down by nearly 6% while blazers and formal jackets fell by 10% year on year, according to market analysts Kantar. Jacob Rees-Mogg may be hiding inside a giant ill-fitting suit, but the typical British man is not only unlikely to have to wear a jacket, tie and tailored trousers to the office but has also eased out of a suit for formal occasions. City banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, once bastions of sharp suits, have relaxed their dress-code to keep pace with rival employers such as tech giants Facebook and Apple, where the founders\u2019 famously casual attire has become the mark of a modern workplace. According to Kantar, more than \u00a3100m has been wiped off annual suit sales since 2015. British men spent \u00a3393m on suits in the year to the end of August and they paid an average of just \u00a3102 for each purchase. The downturn has left high street suits specialists struggling. Moss Bros issued three profits warnings last year while Yorkshire-based menswear chain Greenwoods called in administrators earlier this year. Even James Bond doesn\u2019t always wear a suit these days \u2013 with Daniel Craig seen sporting a cardigan and a bomber jacket in the last two films of the franchise. \u201cIt\u2019s a generational trend,\u201d says Chloe Collins, an analyst at GlobalData. \u201cOffices tend to have more relaxed attire and in general men have got more options. They want to be more fashionable and have the opportunity to update their look which you can do more with casual wear.\u201d She says younger men are more interested in fashion and more confident about choosing outfits, so less reliant on the safe uniform of a suit for work or occasions. Retailers such as Asos and other young fashion stores are also helping men put together more interesting formalwear outfits. \u201cThere\u2019s more inspiration out there \u2013 celebrities going to an event are wearing something fashionable rather than just a suit and tie and that gives men more confidence to try things out,\u201d she says. From the rise of freelancing and working from home, to the decline of the kind of nightclubs that demand smart attire, changing habits mean spending on workwear and clothes for a big night out is down, with men spending a fifth more on gym and fitness kit and smart daywear. Tighter budgets are also putting a squeeze on the suit. \u201cConsumers want to get more usage out of their clothes,\u201d says Glen Tooke, consumer insight director at Kantar. He says men might buy a blazer, some smart shirts and a pair of tailored trousers and then combine them with jeans or knitwear to give a variety of looks suitable for both home and office. \u201cYou no longer need two wardrobes,\u201d Tooke adds. \u201cPeople say they want to show who they are by the way they dress and the suit potentially doesn\u2019t allow you to do that. \u201cThere are things it\u2019s still deemed you need to wear a suit for, but those events are becoming fewer and farther between,\u201d says Tooke. To get more in tune with those trends, Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s menswear boss Wes Taylor told analysts this week that the retailer, which sells one in seven suits in the UK, would be cutting back the number of suits and formalwear options on sale by 14% while increasing leisurewear by 12%. Its a sad moment for the modern lounge suit \u2013 a short jacket and trousers of the same fabric \u2013 which first came to prominence in the 1860s. Popularised by the then Prince of Wales, over the ensuing decades it replaced the then traditional frock coat as the uniform for business wear and respectability. By the 1950s and early 60s those in white collar jobs, such as banking, insurance or the legal profession were expected to wear a suit to work and even men who wore overalls or a uniform to work were likely to change into a suit to go out for the evening. The suit has been in decline since then, according to Eric Musgrave, author of Sharp Suits, a history of mens\u2019 tailoring. He says that change has been exacerbated by the rise in popularity of the athleisure look. But Musgrave says the suit still has a place \u2013 as signified by the all-prevailing presence of suits in politics and when world leaders meet. \u201cThe suit is still a signal you are respectable and powerful. It is the uniform of people who run the world.\u201d Thanks to wannabe world leaders, and many others who want to look smart, the UK suit market is still worth nearly \u00a3400m a year while sales of smart shirts and trousers are still on the rise. Brian Brick, chief executive of Moss Bros, says the chain\u2019s suit sales are up this year despite the overall fall in the market, with younger people still splashing out on a special suit for a special occasion. It\u2019s the everyday suit that is in the doldrums. \u201cThe replacement suit, which somebody is wearing for work, that part of the market is tougher,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are buying for the big moment.\u201d When they do buy for a big day, Brick says they are being more adventurous \u2013 looking for tweed or other interesting fabrics or a light coloured suit for a wedding. \u201cThe younger generation want something more fashionable and on-trend. We are talking about a new formal \u2013 a suit but worn differently.\u201d Taylor agrees, saying that M&amp;S isn\u2019t ditching the suit but giving it a good tweak. \u201cMen now wear elements of a suit with more casual items such as rollnecks and trainers, and we need to be the go-to for these casual items that work alongside great blazers and trousers,\u201d he says. Teo van den Broeke, style and grooming director of menswear mag British GQ, thinks suits are far from dead \u2013 and might even be about to make a comeback, pointing to the menswear catwalks at Balenciaga and Gucci and the fashion choices of young actors such as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and influential older men such as David Beckham. \u201cThere is something to be said for a man in tailoring. It is much better on a date or a job interview than a track suit. No man over 18 looks good in that at any time.\u201d",

He said: \u201cTheir occupancy rates are high and there\u2019s definite demand for this but they have a lot of high fixed costs, regardless of whether [each building] is full or empty, or the yield per desk is going up or down.\u201d According to accounts filed at Companies House, UK landlords are expecting rent payments from WeWork that could top \u00a35bn over the course of its lease agreements. The 2017 accounts show that subsidiaries of the UK parent company, WeWork International Ltd, have signed non-cancellable operating leases worth more than \u00a33.2bn. WeWork has formed at least 50 new companies since then, indicating rent commitments are likely to have risen substantially. Each of these firms was created solely to house separate premises where office space could be hired out to new customers. If WeWork does decide it needs to shrink to survive, it could simply place some of those companies into administration, leaving landlords high and dry. \u201cThe challenge will be if WeWork faces headwinds and takes the same route as retailers by folding those individual companies,\u201d said one property industry veteran. \u201cWith so many WeWorks in close proximity to each other, it could easily consolidate tenants in one building, leaving a landlord with an empty space.\u201d This model, coupled with WeWork\u2019s demands for lucrative concessions from landlords, has deterred some property owners from doing business with them. Simon Wainwright, chief executive of JPW Real Estate, acted for the landlord of a large office building in the City in negotiations with WeWork this summer. His client opted for another tenant. \u201cThey [WeWork] wanted 15-months\u2019 rent free on an eight-year lease, but they also wanted us to cough up \u00a3100 a sq ft in a cash contribution; this would pay for their fit out, desks and generous introductory fees for the brokers they use,\u201d he said. The eventual rental offer was good, but Wainwright said there was no UK company guarantee if things went wrong. \u201cThe problems will come further down the line when the rent-free [agreements] expire,\u201d he said. The back-loaded nature of WeWork\u2019s rental agreements is one reason why the company is, in the short-term at least, able to offer customers so many freebies. At its 16-storey London HQ in Waterloo, WeWork offers tenants \u2013 as well as its own employees \u2013 plenty of inducements on top of the skateboard ramp and DJ decks. Baristas brew free coffee all day long, while there are free classes with names such as \u201cWellness: Boomcycle\u201d and \u201cYoga: The Flow\u201d. Far from expecting any job cuts, staff there were this week in good spirits, despite the meltdown of the IPO and the demotion of the group\u2019s founder. One salesperson said there was no private office space left in the building. This makes sense, despite WeWork\u2019s public travail, according to Oakley. \u201cYou have to separate the debate about whether the value of the company is right to whether the business model is right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like some retailers that expand too fast but don\u2019t stabilise income in existing stores. Their cash burn has more to do with expansion than whether existing centres are profitable.\u201d If the worst were to happen and WeWork were to fail, Oakley believes the London commercial property market wouldn\u2019t suffer too much, as office space is undersupplied and in demand. Instead, he said, it could be the reputation of the serviced office industry that suffers. \u201cIt would be very bad for the perception of this sector,\u201d Oakley said. \u201cThe biggest shock would be to their ability to raise capital via debt or equity. A failure of this scale would draw into question the whole business model, rather unfairly. Aggressive expansion is not a new mistake.\u201d",

That didn\u2019t change the fact that she had skeletons in her closet, racked up over a long career in the public eye. Or that there were a lot of people ambivalent about her decades of experience in American politics \u2013 and eager for a fresh face. There are many reasons why Clinton did not become president, but the right\u2019s ability to weaponize her past as a consummate Beltway insider didn\u2019t help. The gamble of a Biden nomination, then, is a big one. It\u2019s a bet on whether Americans really do want a return to the political establishment when signs here and around the world seem to be pointing in the opposite direction, empowering both far-right strong men and socialists as center-left and center-right parties stumble. Biden\u2019s chances in a general election also hinge on whether he can muster support from enough Obama-loyal, reliable primary voters to counteract a lack of enthusiasm among younger and more progressive segments of the electorate, who won\u2019t back him with nearly the same vim as they would Elizabeth Warren or (especially) Bernie Sanders. Did the mythical white working class voters that Biden is supposed to appeal to really just want to vote for another white guy (as cynical pundits have claimed) or did they too want to drain the swamp? Establishment Democrats have trolled progressive insurgents about policies they see as too far left, such as a Green New Deal or Medicare for All, arguing that they\u2019ll just be cannon fodder for Fox News, Trump and his base during a general election. According to a new poll from Data for Progress and YouGov, the Green New Deal is popular even in swing districts, and a majority of Republicans would support Medicare for All. The greatest risk to Democrats taking back the White House come next November isn\u2019t a set of popular policy proposals. It\u2019s making the exact same mistakes they did in 2016. Luckily, Democrats have not yet found themselves in a hostage situation having to awkwardly go to bat for a flawed candidate on the grounds that the other guy is worse. They still have alternatives: Sanders and Warren. The two are different in style and substance but share the unique virtue of not carrying anywhere close to the kind of tainted legacy Joe Biden would schlep with him into a general election. Their platforms also happen to include big, ambitious ideas that put them at odds with party elites \u2013 Sanders much more so than Warren. After 2016, that could be an electoral boon next November. As Fox News and the right swing into full-blown attack mode, the question the party faces now is what they\u2019d rather spend half a year defending in the general election: sweeping policy proposals offering a credible threat to improve people\u2019s lives, or Hunter Biden?

In Argentina, the company has reported very positive figures on traceability to farm level in direct sourcing for the main regions of expansion (Salta, Chaco and Tucum\u00e1n). Bunge\u2019s work involves improving traceability, monitoring sourcing farms and identifying suitable areas for agricultural expansion with no need to further deforestation of natural landscapes. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Cargill:</h2> <blockquote> <p>In line with our Forest Policy, we are focused on achieving traceability in our supply chains to a level that will most efficiently allow us to identify \u2013 and take action to reduce \u2013 deforestation risk.</p> <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.cargill.com/sustainability/sustainable-soy\">Policy on Sustainable Soy</a> calls for the protection of native vegetation beyond forests with the aim to end native vegetation conversion in the shortest time possible reconciling the production of soy with environmental, economic and social interests. We specifically call out the Gran Chaco as one of the key biomes to direct further actions towards.</p> <p>Our studies indicate that 80% of Argentina\u2019s soy crop was produced in the Pampa biome and about 15% in the Chaco. 97% of the last season\u2019s soy crop was produced on land converted prior to 2014.

It is also important to underline that LDC\u2019s commitment to sustainable soy is the same in Argentina as in other soy-producing countries, as covered by our Sustainable Soy Policy.</p> <p>Concerning Argentina more specifically, we have seen the level of certification and traceability of soybeans in the country rise over the past few years, thanks to ongoing efforts to secure them both along the value chain. The soybeans we purchase in Argentina are certified under the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), European RFS2 and International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) schemes, which require that soybeans are not cultivated on land deforested since 2008.</p> <p>As you will have seen in our 2017 Sustainability Report (p52), the number of certified farms we purchase from in Argentina increased fivefold between 2012/2013 and 2016/2017 harvests [eg 5,800 farms certified US EPA in 2017 \u2013 up from 1,390 in 2015; and 4,800 farms certified <a href=\"https://certifications.controlunion.com/en/certification-programs/certification-programs/2bsvs-biomass-biofuel-sustainability-voluntary-scheme\">2BSvs</a>]. This does not mean that the remaining soybeans we purchase are not sustainable, but that they are not yet certified. The traceability of our soy purchases will continue to increase as we roll out our soy policy. For all our direct purchases in Argentina, shipments are accompanied by a \u201ccarta del porte\u201d document, which tracks farm-level origination.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>As part of continued efforts to map, monitor and improve our soy supply chain in Argentina, our team conducted a detailed supply chain mapping and risk assessment exercise in the country during 2018. This provided traceability to the municipality in which farms are located for all the soybeans LDC sources directly from farmers in the country. We then did a complete risk assessment for every relevant municipality based on: the native forest in the municipality; any recorded recent deforestation; the legal categorization of the land.</p> <p>The result of this exercise indicated that the risk level for our existing soy supply chain in Argentina is low. This is likely also due to the fact that the majority of our origination and logistics network is based around Rosario, towards the south. This does not mean that there is no risk in our supply chain, but \u2013 as elsewhere \u2013 we are working to implement our soy policy and will partner where appropriate with specialist organisations to help us do so.</p> <p>In 2018, we also contributed to the Argentina Agroideal multi-stakeholder group that is identifying areas where expanding soy farming is suitable, in order to avoid any deforestation or environmental damage. We aim to continue these efforts to develop and improve the overall sustainability profile of the soy sector, while recognising that there is still much to be done. We are certainly looking to remain a key part of the solutions.

This includes improving traceability, and supporting certified zero deforestation soy production, so that all soy used as animal feed in our UK supply chain is sourced from regions which are verified as zero deforestation.</p> <p>Second response: As we explained in our initial reply, there is a problem with soy traceability in general, hence the industry-leading plan we\u2019ve developed to fix it. It begins with buying credits to support soy growing from non-deforested areas, while direct traceability is not possible ie we\u2019re supporting zero-deforestation proportionate to our supply while we fix traceability.</p> <p>Then it moves to direct traceability ie soy from farms we know are not deforested.

Here the orphanage stands in for the church, or authority in general, as a thing that crushes your spirit for your own good. Elliott likens his suffering to that of \u201cthe Israelites in the wilderness for 40 years\u201d, and observes that Jim is \u201ctoo much of a martyr and really really above all too much like Jesus\u201d. Like many before him, Elliott\u2019s understanding of Christian values leads him to fight against the very institution that instilled them. He hatches an elaborate plan \u2013 which he describes with droll grandiloquence as \u201ca conspiracy of unprecedented sophistication and magnitude\u201d \u2013 to have Jim wheel him out of the orphanage and away to freedom. Perhaps the path to grace lies not in being docile and good, as the Sisters would like, but in a single, glorious act of defiance.</p> <p>But to reduce this novel to a philosophical allegory would do a disservice to its emotional depth. It is as much a story about the innate human need for friendship: the intensity of Elliott\u2019s yearning to connect, and his unbridled happiness upon doing so, speak to something universal. Now that he has secured an ally in the world, life takes on a new and overwhelming vividness: \u201cthere was always more gorgeous detail than I had time or senses for and every caterpillar-of-a-When immediately became a butterfly-of-a-What and flew off into the flock of a thousand interplexing Whats whose air-dance of now being like this and now being like that was too delicate for anybody to remember but a god.\u201d The vibrancy of Litt\u2019s narrative voice \u2013 at times heartbreakingly plaintive, but also clever, funny and suffused with tenderness \u2013 carries the persistence of hope in circumstances of deep despair. This is a very beautiful book, and deserves to be widely read.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Patience </em>is published by Galley Beggar (\u00a39.99).

He hatches an elaborate plan \u2013 which he describes with droll grandiloquence as \u201ca conspiracy of unprecedented sophistication and magnitude\u201d \u2013 to have Jim wheel him out of the orphanage and away to freedom. Perhaps the path to grace lies not in being docile and good, as the Sisters would like, but in a single, glorious act of defiance. But to reduce this novel to a philosophical allegory would do a disservice to its emotional depth. It is as much a story about the innate human need for friendship: the intensity of Elliott\u2019s yearning to connect, and his unbridled happiness upon doing so, speak to something universal. Now that he has secured an ally in the world, life takes on a new and overwhelming vividness: \u201cthere was always more gorgeous detail than I had time or senses for and every caterpillar-of-a-When immediately became a butterfly-of-a-What and flew off into the flock of a thousand interplexing Whats whose air-dance of now being like this and now being like that was too delicate for anybody to remember but a god.\u201d The vibrancy of Litt\u2019s narrative voice \u2013 at times heartbreakingly plaintive, but also clever, funny and suffused with tenderness \u2013 carries the persistence of hope in circumstances of deep despair. This is a very beautiful book, and deserves to be widely read. \u2022 Patience is published by Galley Beggar (\u00a39.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

The police came and we all had to run away; we were like gazelles \u2013 they never caught us.\u201d</p> <p>Before they started writing songs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/06/haim-the-soft-rock-sisters-on-working-hard-to-sound-effortless\">Haim</a> were obsessed with LA rock folklore, reading books about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/15/joni-mitchells-albums-ranked\">Joni Mitchell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/14/david-crosby-trump-country-stills-nash-byrds-election\">Crosby</a>, Stills and Nash, and forensically studying episodes of VH1\u2019s Behind the Music. When people started taking interest in their own band \u2013 before topping 2013\u2019s BBC Sound Of... poll, they would often play covers with their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/22/haim-sisters-days-gone-interview\">parents</a>, under the name Rockinhaim \u2013 they felt prepared after an adolescence imbued in the history of California music.</p> <p>Now, after two albums and the greatest honour of all \u2013 a Saturday Night Live sketch parodying them, starring Tina Fey and Nicki Minaj \u2013 they have become one of the most quintessential LA bands of their generation. Recently, they have formed a creative partnership with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/01/paul-thomas-anderson-you-can-tell-a-lot-about-a-person-by-what-they-order-for-breakfast\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> who, like Haim, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, an area of LA often sniffed at by trendier residents on the other side of the Hollywood hills. He directed their last four music videos, including new single Summer Girl, which sees the sisters removing layers of outerwear at various Valley locations.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjuA_o6Jzyo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZjuA_o6Jzyo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cThe Valley is still not cool but it\u2019s such a big part of who we are, we ride or die for it,\u201d says Este as we pull up round the corner from their family home. \u201cGrowing up, we were surrounded by these virtuoso musicians; not the actual stars who lived in Beverly Hills or wherever you get the actual stars, but like the back-up guitarist for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/20/saucerful-secrets-interstellar-overdrive-pink-floyd-take-spandau-ballet-on-a-psychedelic-trip-nick-mason-gary-kemp\">Pink Floyd</a> or a session player for Pat Benatar; it was unpretentious, and these people would show up at our house and want to jam.\u201d</p> <p>That early musical proficiency and confidence around older wizened rockers quickly defined Haim as artists. Emerging at a time when musicians tend to be introverted, electronic and serious (and guitar music has been declared dead so many times the coroner is hoarse) they have bucked every trend: a band of brash, accomplished female musicians playing classic rock while gaining a reputation as professional goofs, whether that\u2019s with their choreographed dance-routine tour announcements or photobombing Liam Payne at the Brit awards.</p> <p>Our first stop is Art\u2019s Deli and we spend 20 minutes perusing a thesis-length menu of latkes, lox and liver in various combinations. I make a few false attempts at starting the interview for real but a perfectly harmonised rendition of Tenacious D\u2019s 2001 album track Explosivo and a discussion about which S Club 7 song they could cover in the Live Lounge get in the way. Once we get into it, it becomes the clear that their sunny disposition has disguised a difficult period for the band. Having toured and recorded almost non-stop for six years \u2013 during which time their long-time producer (and Danielle\u2019s boyfriend) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/27/ariel-rechtshaid-producer-vampire-weekend-haim-sky-ferreira\">Ariel Rechtshaid</a> had been diagnosed with testicular cancer, Alana\u2019s closest friend had passed away and Este continued to struggle with type 1 diabetes, a condition which she had been managing since childhood that caused her to almost faint during the band\u2019s Glastonbury performance in 2013.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s times when I look back at that time and I really was running away from my problems \u2013 because I could,\u201d says Alana.</p> <p>Danielle, generally the most contemplative of the sisters, was hit particularly hard: \u201cI definitely had a bout of post-tour depression when Ariel got sick; it all kind of just like hit, it hit me really hard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4f442d1a8b2586c507ca0916ce5ade8e4950f3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4f442d1a8b2586c507ca0916ce5ade8e4950f3d/0_16_4806_2883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alana Haim\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alana Haim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xavi Torrent/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That darkness can be heard in the band\u2019s new material, which marks something of a musical departure, particularly on two emotionally brutal songs, Hallelujah, a reflection on loss and recovery, and Now I\u2019m in It, a breathy pop ballad in which Danielle sings she feels \u201calone in my head\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think Now I\u2019m in It is a break-up song because I sing: \u2018We can\u2019t be friends\u2019 but I\u2019m talking about me and my mind. It was gnarly and I was not OK with myself,\u201d says Danielle.</p> <p>\u201cThere were times when collectively all of us were kind of spiralling,\u201d says Este. \u201cI was wanting to support my sister but also supporting her boyfriend; he wanted to get back to work and that was good but I felt guilty that we were sort of making him do the record ... I felt like I had to be strong all the time but most people with type 1 diabetes have depression. You start to get resentful of the disease. But to have my sisters take care of me, and remind me that I wanna dance at my great-granddaughter\u2019s wedding, Hallelujah is a reflection of how lucky we are to have each other.\u201d</p> <p>Haim have always worn their musical inspirations on their sleeve, but got mixed reviews for their second album, including the accusation that their nods to tasteful 80s and 90s influences sometimes overwhelmed their own voice. These new songs feel more quintessentially Haim; stripped back and direct, as if they\u2019ve been brewing for decades. \u201cAfter we\u2019d finished some of these songs we were like: \u2018Holy shit this is some of the best songs we\u2019ve ever done,\u2019\u201d says Danielle.</p> <p>After plates of smoked fish are licked clean and excess latke apple sauce is taken to go, we head to Canter\u2019s, a 1950s deli in Fairfax with a tiny club, the Kibbutz Room, in the back, where Haim played one of their first ever gigs. Haim are more than Jewish: they fast on Yom Kippur even if they have a gig and Summer Girl contains an interpolation of lyrics from Lo Yisa Goy, a song sung at Jewish summer camps. As more rounds of pastrami and pickles arrive, I wonder if there is ever a time they feel self-conscious about their heritage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f635db19dd473a1200871441a49e7d0cc4612cef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f635db19dd473a1200871441a49e7d0cc4612cef/0_26_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Este Haim\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Este Haim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe one thing about being in LA: going to a Jewish deli is so normal for us.

      "bodyText": "A tip if you are ever visiting Los Angeles: don\u2019t be suckered in by those open-top bus tours of celebrity homes, where some wannabe actor in a headset delivers made-up facts about the Kardashian vineyards. Instead, just take a drive with Este Haim, and experience the history of La La Land as told through the eyes of her and her sisters\u2019 teenage misadventure. \u201cThat\u2019s where Eagles recorded Hotel California,\u201d says Este, pointing at an impressive home from the front seat of an SUV while her two sisters, Alana and Danielle, sit in the back. \u201cThat\u2019s where Alana had her first car crash,\u201d the eldest and often the loudest of the trio continues, shifting into the authoritative tone of a celebrity TV travelogue as we career over Laurel Canyon. \u201cAnd this is Jenny Lewis\u2019s house; we snuck into her fourth-of-July pool party wearing Budweiser swimsuits. This was Houdini\u2019s house, then it was Frank Zappa\u2019s house, then it was the house I broke into with all my girlfriends and we held a seance. The police came and we all had to run away; we were like gazelles \u2013 they never caught us.\u201d Before they started writing songs, Haim were obsessed with LA rock folklore, reading books about Joni Mitchell and Crosby, Stills and Nash, and forensically studying episodes of VH1\u2019s Behind the Music. When people started taking interest in their own band \u2013 before topping 2013\u2019s BBC Sound Of... poll, they would often play covers with their parents, under the name Rockinhaim \u2013 they felt prepared after an adolescence imbued in the history of California music. Now, after two albums and the greatest honour of all \u2013 a Saturday Night Live sketch parodying them, starring Tina Fey and Nicki Minaj \u2013 they have become one of the most quintessential LA bands of their generation. Recently, they have formed a creative partnership with Paul Thomas Anderson who, like Haim, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, an area of LA often sniffed at by trendier residents on the other side of the Hollywood hills. He directed their last four music videos, including new single Summer Girl, which sees the sisters removing layers of outerwear at various Valley locations. \u201cThe Valley is still not cool but it\u2019s such a big part of who we are, we ride or die for it,\u201d says Este as we pull up round the corner from their family home. \u201cGrowing up, we were surrounded by these virtuoso musicians; not the actual stars who lived in Beverly Hills or wherever you get the actual stars, but like the back-up guitarist for Pink Floyd or a session player for Pat Benatar; it was unpretentious, and these people would show up at our house and want to jam.\u201d That early musical proficiency and confidence around older wizened rockers quickly defined Haim as artists. Emerging at a time when musicians tend to be introverted, electronic and serious (and guitar music has been declared dead so many times the coroner is hoarse) they have bucked every trend: a band of brash, accomplished female musicians playing classic rock while gaining a reputation as professional goofs, whether that\u2019s with their choreographed dance-routine tour announcements or photobombing Liam Payne at the Brit awards. Our first stop is Art\u2019s Deli and we spend 20 minutes perusing a thesis-length menu of latkes, lox and liver in various combinations. I make a few false attempts at starting the interview for real but a perfectly harmonised rendition of Tenacious D\u2019s 2001 album track Explosivo and a discussion about which S Club 7 song they could cover in the Live Lounge get in the way. Once we get into it, it becomes the clear that their sunny disposition has disguised a difficult period for the band. Having toured and recorded almost non-stop for six years \u2013 during which time their long-time producer (and Danielle\u2019s boyfriend) Ariel Rechtshaid had been diagnosed with testicular cancer, Alana\u2019s closest friend had passed away and Este continued to struggle with type 1 diabetes, a condition which she had been managing since childhood that caused her to almost faint during the band\u2019s Glastonbury performance in 2013. \u201cThere\u2019s times when I look back at that time and I really was running away from my problems \u2013 because I could,\u201d says Alana. Danielle, generally the most contemplative of the sisters, was hit particularly hard: \u201cI definitely had a bout of post-tour depression when Ariel got sick; it all kind of just like hit, it hit me really hard.\u201d That darkness can be heard in the band\u2019s new material, which marks something of a musical departure, particularly on two emotionally brutal songs, Hallelujah, a reflection on loss and recovery, and Now I\u2019m in It, a breathy pop ballad in which Danielle sings she feels \u201calone in my head\u201d. \u201cPeople think Now I\u2019m in It is a break-up song because I sing: \u2018We can\u2019t be friends\u2019 but I\u2019m talking about me and my mind. It was gnarly and I was not OK with myself,\u201d says Danielle. \u201cThere were times when collectively all of us were kind of spiralling,\u201d says Este. \u201cI was wanting to support my sister but also supporting her boyfriend; he wanted to get back to work and that was good but I felt guilty that we were sort of making him do the record ... I felt like I had to be strong all the time but most people with type 1 diabetes have depression. You start to get resentful of the disease. But to have my sisters take care of me, and remind me that I wanna dance at my great-granddaughter\u2019s wedding, Hallelujah is a reflection of how lucky we are to have each other.\u201d Haim have always worn their musical inspirations on their sleeve, but got mixed reviews for their second album, including the accusation that their nods to tasteful 80s and 90s influences sometimes overwhelmed their own voice. These new songs feel more quintessentially Haim; stripped back and direct, as if they\u2019ve been brewing for decades. \u201cAfter we\u2019d finished some of these songs we were like: \u2018Holy shit this is some of the best songs we\u2019ve ever done,\u2019\u201d says Danielle. After plates of smoked fish are licked clean and excess latke apple sauce is taken to go, we head to Canter\u2019s, a 1950s deli in Fairfax with a tiny club, the Kibbutz Room, in the back, where Haim played one of their first ever gigs. Haim are more than Jewish: they fast on Yom Kippur even if they have a gig and Summer Girl contains an interpolation of lyrics from Lo Yisa Goy, a song sung at Jewish summer camps. As more rounds of pastrami and pickles arrive, I wonder if there is ever a time they feel self-conscious about their heritage. \u201cThe one thing about being in LA: going to a Jewish deli is so normal for us. When we\u2019re touring around America, there\u2019s not just a place that Jews are just chilling,\u201d says Danielle. \u201cIt is interesting to us to go to places in middle America where being Jewish is more like being an outsider. We are in a bubble and I think we take that for granted.\u201d As more rounds of pastrami and pickles arrive, there is a more determined tone in the air and the sisters repeat a refrain of not taking any bullshit this time around, particularly from a male-dominated music industry. \u201cI mean,\u201d Danielle continues, \u201cthere was definitely a time when we wanted to be on the rock stations, and they were saying that we weren\u2019t rock enough, which felt like a big slap in the face, especially when they play so many bands that make the same shit as us but they\u2019re men and they play them.\u201d \u201cWhat rock bands don\u2019t understand about us, is that we make fun of ourselves; we love to have fun but sometimes that makes people think we don\u2019t take music seriously,\u201d says Alana as the sisters start to rile each other up. \u201cYeah! I can go toe-to-toe with any male rock band and blow them out of the water,\u201d shouts Este. The band has had some ugly brushes with the established men of the music industry in the past, particularly from Portishead\u2019s Geoff Barrow who tweets regularly about how much he dislikes them: \u201cHaim are not woman! they are robots sent here from the CIA/Time Warner lab to fill a playlist gap where decent music could be\u201d and \u201cWhy the fuk are haim pretending their rise to fame was organic ? Unless massive marketing spends are now considered organic nowadays?\u201d Alana says that Barrow\u2019s tweets did actually push her to take action at one point. \u201cEvery fucking week he would say more and more shit. Then we were at this festival somewhere in Finland and Portishead were headlining, we were on just before.

Sludge holds nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients that help crops grow, so the waste management industry lightly treats it and sells it cheaply to farmers who view it as a cost-saving product.</p> <p>But in fact the excrement from which sludge derives has mixed with any number of 80,000 manmade chemicals that are discharged from industry\u2019s pipes or otherwise pumped into the sewer system. By the time the mix lands in treatment plants, it can teem with pharmaceuticals, hormones, pathogens, bacteria, viruses, protozoa and parasitic worms, as well as heavy metals like lead, cadmium, arsenic or mercury. It often includes PCBs, PFAS, dioxins, BPAs and dozens of other harmful substances ranging from flame retardants to hospital waste.</p> <p>\u201cSpending billions of dollars to remove hazardous chemicals and biological wastes from water, only to spread them on soil everywhere we live, work and play defies common sense,\u201d said David Lewis, a former Environmental Protection Agency scientist who opposed spreading sludge on cropland in the mid-1990s as the agency approved the use.</p> <p>Previously treatment facilities burned sludge or dumped it in the ocean, but the federal government barred the practices because doing so violated clean air rules or created marine dead zones. The EPA now insists spreading the same toxic substance on farmland is safe.</p> <p>Raine questioned that conclusion, noting that there is very little regulation, very little testing and no knowing what\u2019s in each batch of sludge as compositions vary.</p> <p>In what biosolid testing the EPA has conducted, it identified more than 350 pollutants. That includes 61 it classifies \u201cas acutely hazardous, hazardous or priority pollutants\u201d, but the law requires only nine of those be removed. Moreover, the EPA and wastewater treatment plants don\u2019t test for or otherwise analyze most of the 80,000 manmade chemicals.</p> <p>In a scathing <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/office-inspector-general/report-epa-unable-assess-impact-hundreds-unregulated-pollutants-land\">2018 report</a>, the EPA office of inspector general noted the agency couldn\u2019t properly regulate biosolids, even if it sincerely tried, because \u201cit lacked the data or risk assessment tools needed to make a determination on the safety of 352 pollutants found in biosolids\u201d.</p> <p>Though regulators and industry don\u2019t know what\u2019s in biosolids, there\u2019s strong evidence that it can be dangerous.</p> <p>A University of North Carolina <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1205470\">study </a>found 75% of people living near farms that spread biosolids experienced health issues like burning eyes, nausea, vomiting, boils and rashes, while others have contracted MRSA, a penicillin-resistant \u201csuperbug\u201d. </p> <p>In South Carolina, sludge containing high levels of carcinogenic PCBs was <a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9112850.html\">spread on cropland</a>, and in Georgia sludge <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/26/us/sludge-spread-on-fields-is-fodder-for-lawsuits.html\">killed cows</a>.

PFAS, or \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, are linked to a range of serious health problems like cancer, thyroid disorders, immune disorders and low birth weight.

In Michigan, an environmental official <a href=\"https://bluejeans.com/playback/s/612RDp5KxezKzFhRkTMCeoENuw3GdFqyKtgTB7zBwyb4fCGhcL7NKesuUTogBF7T\">recently said</a> the state won\u2019t test for PFAS in milk because it doesn\u2019t want to put farmers out of business.

Paul Wohlfarth, a resident of Riga Township, Michigan, said sludge is contaminating his well, and charged that biosolids from the state\u2019s cities were \u201cturning Riga Township into a waste dump\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you put heavy metals, PFAS, plastics, pharmaceuticals and all that in the soil, sooner or later it gets toxic, and you can\u2019t wish that stuff away.

      "bodyText": "By some estimates, Americans send about 300m pounds of feces daily from the nation\u2019s toilets to wastewater treatment plants. While the water is cleaned and discharged, the remaining toxic sewage sludge stays at the treatment plant, and it\u2019s what Sierra Club environmentalist Nancy Raine calls \u201cthe most pollutant-rich manmade substance on Earth\u201d. This \u201cbiosolid\u201d sludge is expensive to dispose of because it must be landfilled, but the waste management industry is increasingly using a money-making alternative \u2013 repackaging the sludge as fertilizer and injecting it into the nation\u2019s food chain. Now the practice is behind a growing number of public health problems. Spreading pollutant-filled biosolids on farmland is making people sick, contaminating drinking water and filling crops, livestock and humans with everything from pharmaceuticals to PFAS. As more biosolid-linked crises develop, some farmers and environmentalists are calling for a ban on the practice. In 2019, about 60% of sewage sludge produced by treatment facilities will be spread on farmland and gardens, as well as schoolyards and lawns. Sludge holds nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients that help crops grow, so the waste management industry lightly treats it and sells it cheaply to farmers who view it as a cost-saving product. But in fact the excrement from which sludge derives has mixed with any number of 80,000 manmade chemicals that are discharged from industry\u2019s pipes or otherwise pumped into the sewer system. By the time the mix lands in treatment plants, it can teem with pharmaceuticals, hormones, pathogens, bacteria, viruses, protozoa and parasitic worms, as well as heavy metals like lead, cadmium, arsenic or mercury. It often includes PCBs, PFAS, dioxins, BPAs and dozens of other harmful substances ranging from flame retardants to hospital waste. \u201cSpending billions of dollars to remove hazardous chemicals and biological wastes from water, only to spread them on soil everywhere we live, work and play defies common sense,\u201d said David Lewis, a former Environmental Protection Agency scientist who opposed spreading sludge on cropland in the mid-1990s as the agency approved the use. Previously treatment facilities burned sludge or dumped it in the ocean, but the federal government barred the practices because doing so violated clean air rules or created marine dead zones. The EPA now insists spreading the same toxic substance on farmland is safe. Raine questioned that conclusion, noting that there is very little regulation, very little testing and no knowing what\u2019s in each batch of sludge as compositions vary. In what biosolid testing the EPA has conducted, it identified more than 350 pollutants. That includes 61 it classifies \u201cas acutely hazardous, hazardous or priority pollutants\u201d, but the law requires only nine of those be removed. Moreover, the EPA and wastewater treatment plants don\u2019t test for or otherwise analyze most of the 80,000 manmade chemicals. In a scathing 2018 report, the EPA office of inspector general noted the agency couldn\u2019t properly regulate biosolids, even if it sincerely tried, because \u201cit lacked the data or risk assessment tools needed to make a determination on the safety of 352 pollutants found in biosolids\u201d. Though regulators and industry don\u2019t know what\u2019s in biosolids, there\u2019s strong evidence that it can be dangerous. A University of North Carolina study found 75% of people living near farms that spread biosolids experienced health issues like burning eyes, nausea, vomiting, boils and rashes, while others have contracted MRSA, a penicillin-resistant \u201csuperbug\u201d. In South Carolina, sludge containing high levels of carcinogenic PCBs was spread on cropland, and in Georgia sludge killed cows. Biosolids are also thought to be partly responsible for toxic algae blooms in the Great Lakes and Florida, and biosolid treatment centers regularly pollute the air around them. Meanwhile, sewage sludge is behind a widening PFAS crisis that has contaminated farms in Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin, Alabama and Florida. PFAS, or \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, are linked to a range of serious health problems like cancer, thyroid disorders, immune disorders and low birth weight. The chemicals are a product used to make non-stick or water-resistant products, and are found in everything from raincoats to dental floss to food packaging. Maine\u2019s testing of 44 fields sprayed with biosolids earlier this year consistently found alarming PFAS levels in the ground, cows and farmers\u2019 blood, which forced one dairy farm to shut down. \u201cThey\u2019re finding kilograms of PFAS in sewage sludge when nanograms are harmful to humans, so you can\u2019t regulate it as a fertilizer,\u201d said Laura Orlando, a civil engineer who tracks problems with biosolids. Still, state governments continue to allow biosolids to be spread on farmland or sold in compost. In Michigan, an environmental official recently said the state won\u2019t test for PFAS in milk because it doesn\u2019t want to put farmers out of business. A spokesperson for Michigan\u2019s department of environment, Great Lakes and energy did not respond to specific questions about biosolid use, but said the state had increased PFAS testing, and in 2017 it issued suggestions for biosolids applications. However, the Sierra Club\u2019s Great Lakes manager, Christy McGillivray, noted that Michigan doesn\u2019t have PFAS standards, so \u201cthat makes it impossible to regulate\u201d.

You\u2019re ruining the topsoil forever,\u201d he said. Though the government is reacting slowly or ignoring problems, companies like Whole Foods, Dole, Heinz and Del Monte won\u2019t buy crops grown in biosolids, while Switzerland, the Netherlands and other countries have banned it. Still, the wastewater industry has strongly denied that health issues exist and regularly calls any contrary evidence anecdotal. The Great Lakes water authority, which operates one of the nation\u2019s largest biosolid programs, declined interview requests from the Guardian. Despite sludge\u2019s chemical makeup, the wastewater industry bills biosolids as \u201cgreen\u201d and even sells it as organic fertilizer in stores like Walmart and Lowe\u2019s, though packaging doesn\u2019t indicate that it\u2019s composed of human and industrial waste. The waste management industry treats sludge in several ways before labeling it fertilizer \u2013 air drying, pasteurization and composting are among common methods. Lime is employed to raise the pH level to eliminate odors, and about 95% of pathogens, viruses and other organisms are killed in the process. But Raine stressed that none of the thousands of chemicals known to be in biosolids, or tens of thousands of manmade chemicals for which the government doesn\u2019t test, are removed. \u201cIt has a technical song that sounds pretty good. However, nothing that is done to the sludge removes the chemicals,\u201d Raine said. \u201cThey just spend a little money on PR to convince us it\u2019s nice fertilizer and fail to mention all the other things that are in it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Improve your base fitness A recommended way to get started would be to use the rower for a sustained period at a lower intensity. Rather than pushing too hard, the focus is on consistency in your strokes per minute, technique and breathing patterns. You can then work towards high-intensity intervals. Have the right foot strap position The foot strap should allow your mid-foot to flex, rather than being too tight and keeping it rigid. If the straps become loose as you row, they will prevent you from applying pressure and pressing through your feet, as you extend your legs. Use a low air resistance One of the most common misconceptions is that using a higher resistance setting means you are fitter, stronger or better at rowing. The way to develop power is to increase your speed over a distance. A resistance setting of between 2 and 6 is more than enough even for professional rowers. \u2022 Marvin Burton is head of fitness at Anytime Fitness.

A few years later, early Everest expeditions trained here, scaling Y Lliwedd, another outlying peak of Snowdon (and together with Crib Goch forming the famed Snowdon Horseshoe scramble).

I am with my daughter Maddy (16) who, I think it\u2019s fair to say, has different boundaries in the risk business.

Her beaming smile afterwards tells how important the experience has been.</p> <p>Next up is the surfing, Adventure Parcs\u2019 raison d\u2019etre. In a 300-metre long shallow lagoon an underwater snowplough forces up an impressive two-metre wave every 90 seconds. A careful arrangement of reefs means every surfing ability gets a chance. We start as beginners, then graduate to intermediate. It\u2019s not a cheap experience, but the sheer predictability and regularity of the wave means surfing technique can be improved rapidly \u2013 not a bad idea for those of us whose surfing careers are starting late in life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29d8a5ab7842266fe95077418d9be9f82bce7fbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29d8a5ab7842266fe95077418d9be9f82bce7fbb/0_0_4699_2820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surfers on the surf lagoon at Adventure Parc Snowdonia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New wave \u2026 the surf lagoon at Adventure Parc Snowdonia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Snowdonia\u2019s old slate quarries, once an eyesore, are being reinvented too. Next day we try Zipworld at Penrhyn quarry, home to Velocity 2 \u2013 the fastest zipline in the world \u2013 plus a new karting track. The former is certainly a thrill, but is it an adventure? With training videos, faultless safety equipment and even a small-scale training wire, Maddy and I both feel this adrenaline rush has a rather long-winded preamble, too much waiting time, and little sense of danger. Unlike the quarry karts. These German-built vehicles have brakes, but rely on the slope for speed. Down the track you go, whipping through hairpin bends, a tunnel and various chicanes and steep drops. It gets a massive thumbs up from both of us.</p> <p>Zipworld has two other sites, both of which we sample. At Blaenau Ffestiniog there are more zipwires but we try the underground stuff: a vast cavern, artfully lit, home to various trampolines, slides and via ferrata experiences. This pleases us both and definitely wins the award for most dramatic location. Over in Betws-y-Coed we also try Zipworld Fforest, where there\u2019s a tree-top assault course and Coaster, a rollercoaster in a forest. This is a lot of fun: the fact that you control the brake means everyone chooses their own level of speed, and fear.</p> <p>There are many more adventures available here: packrafting down the River Conwy or a whitewater kayak lesson on the Lugwy. Mountain bikers can even climb Snowdon then freewheel down (except between 10am and 5pm, May-September).</p> <p>For me, however, Crib Goch was always the Snowdonia ultimate. I\u2019ve wanted to do it since I was 10, when my dad pointed it out as we hiked up the straightforward Pyg track. It\u2019s a grade one scramble, ranked alongside the Lake District\u2019s Striding Edge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a55c25e232bc3237825d865f8bd7aa1be58235bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a55c25e232bc3237825d865f8bd7aa1be58235bc/0_444_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walkers on the Pyg track up Snowdon, with the railway on the horizon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walkers on the Pyg track up Snowdon, with the railway on the horizon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The obvious starting point is at Pen-y-pass car park, a place that can be full by 6am on sunny summer days. Easier is to park in Lllanberis or Betws-y-Coed and take a bus. Our day proves cold and blustery. One look at the Crib Goch\u2019s jagged skyline and we opt to stay on the Pyg trail. The summit is crowded with sponsored walk groups and people who have come up on the train. If you want a quiet mountain walk, Snowdon is not the right choice: Tryfan or Cnicht (aka the Welsh Matterhorn) might be a better bet.</p> <p>While we are in the summit cafe, the sun comes out and spirits rise, so we tackle Crib Goch on the descent.

Next up is the surfing, Adventure Parcs\u2019 raison d\u2019etre. In a 300-metre long shallow lagoon an underwater snowplough forces up an impressive two-metre wave every 90 seconds. A careful arrangement of reefs means every surfing ability gets a chance. We start as beginners, then graduate to intermediate. It\u2019s not a cheap experience, but the sheer predictability and regularity of the wave means surfing technique can be improved rapidly \u2013 not a bad idea for those of us whose surfing careers are starting late in life. Snowdonia\u2019s old slate quarries, once an eyesore, are being reinvented too. Next day we try Zipworld at Penrhyn quarry, home to Velocity 2 \u2013 the fastest zipline in the world \u2013 plus a new karting track. The former is certainly a thrill, but is it an adventure? With training videos, faultless safety equipment and even a small-scale training wire, Maddy and I both feel this adrenaline rush has a rather long-winded preamble, too much waiting time, and little sense of danger. Unlike the quarry karts. These German-built vehicles have brakes, but rely on the slope for speed. Down the track you go, whipping through hairpin bends, a tunnel and various chicanes and steep drops. It gets a massive thumbs up from both of us. Zipworld has two other sites, both of which we sample. At Blaenau Ffestiniog there are more zipwires but we try the underground stuff: a vast cavern, artfully lit, home to various trampolines, slides and via ferrata experiences. This pleases us both and definitely wins the award for most dramatic location. Over in Betws-y-Coed we also try Zipworld Fforest, where there\u2019s a tree-top assault course and Coaster, a rollercoaster in a forest. This is a lot of fun: the fact that you control the brake means everyone chooses their own level of speed, and fear. There are many more adventures available here: packrafting down the River Conwy or a whitewater kayak lesson on the Lugwy. Mountain bikers can even climb Snowdon then freewheel down (except between 10am and 5pm, May-September). For me, however, Crib Goch was always the Snowdonia ultimate. I\u2019ve wanted to do it since I was 10, when my dad pointed it out as we hiked up the straightforward Pyg track. It\u2019s a grade one scramble, ranked alongside the Lake District\u2019s Striding Edge. The obvious starting point is at Pen-y-pass car park, a place that can be full by 6am on sunny summer days. Easier is to park in Lllanberis or Betws-y-Coed and take a bus. Our day proves cold and blustery. One look at the Crib Goch\u2019s jagged skyline and we opt to stay on the Pyg trail. The summit is crowded with sponsored walk groups and people who have come up on the train. If you want a quiet mountain walk, Snowdon is not the right choice: Tryfan or Cnicht (aka the Welsh Matterhorn) might be a better bet. While we are in the summit cafe, the sun comes out and spirits rise, so we tackle Crib Goch on the descent. Be warned, you need a good head for heights, a decent sense of balance and, at times, both hands. The reward is a real adventure. \u2022 The trip was provided by Visit Wales. Adventure Parcs Snowdonia offers 90-minute surf lessons from \u00a350, one-hour sessions from \u00a340, indoor activities from \u00a312 per hour, camping pods \u00a365 per night (sleep up to four, bring your own bedding).

Is retrofitting them with plug-in points the way forward? According to Richard Stobart of Char.gy, one of the firms handed \u00a337m in grants by the Department of Transport to develop new charging schemes, the standard lamp-post is connected to a 25 amp supply. If they have gone over to LED, then that leaves 24 amps for charging cars. \u201cYou will be able to get around 20 miles of driving for every hour of charging at a lamp-post,\u201d says Stobart. Electric cars don\u2019t have to be charged up every night \u2013 Stobart charges his Renault Zoe once a week \u2013 so in an ideal world, one lamp-post could charge many cars each week, especially in cities where mileage tends to be relatively low.</p> <p>Last November Char.gy set up <a href=\"https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2018/oct/southwark-is-first-to-install-city-hall-s-new-electric-vehicle-charging-points\" title=\"\">the first 50 lamp-post charging points in London</a> in a deal with Southwark council, while in February Siemens/Ubitricity began installing <a href=\"https://www.richmond.gov.uk/council/news/press_office/older_news/press_releases_february_2019/time_to_charge_up-_over_200_new_ev_lamp_column_charge_points_in_richmond_upon_thames\" title=\"\">210 in Richmond upon Thames</a>.

For example, in Dundee they have been free, but from November the cost will be 15p/kWh, plus a connection fee of 38p. The latest Nissan Leaf comes with 40kWh battery, and to work out the cost of \u201cfilling up\u201d, you multiply the size of battery (kWh) by the electricity cost in pence per kilowatt hour.

The city is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/16/dundee-green-revolution-charging-hubs-electric-cabs-scotland\" title=\"\">by far the most advanced in the UK</a> in switching to electric vehicles, with 20% of local taxis already entirely electric.</p> <p>Fraser Crichton at Dundee city council says it shares the same challenge as London in building an infrastructure for charging.

For example, there are kerbside charging units dubbed \u201carmadillos\u201d which are made from recycled tyres. There are \u201cgeckos\u201d, which are charge points that can be attached to existing street furniture such as bollards and signs. And then there are \u201climpets\u201d, which are wall-mounted units with perhaps 10 sockets apiece that are designed for places such as long-stay car parks and workplaces. All have been developed by the London-based startup Connected Kerb, which has trialled the armadillos and geckos in two locations this year: Southwark in south London, and Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire.

The company focuses on deploying charging units in long-stay, workplace and residential on-street parking places, where the vehicle \u201cdwell time\u201d is typically longer than three hours. \u201cThis sort of charging isn\u2019t only the most convenient for the user [who can go off, forget about charging and do something else], but it\u2019s also the most suitable from a cost [slow charging is cheaper than fast charging], battery life [slow charging is better for the battery] and grid management [where intelligent slow/fast chargers have less impact than rapids on the grid] perspective,\u201d says Pateman-Jones. Using Virgin Media\u2019s 40,000 street cabinets Virgin Media and its parent company Liberty Global announced earlier this year that they would start using their network of underground cable ducts and street cabinets to install kerbside electric vehicle charging points. \u201cThe cabinets are already powered and could be used to roll out thousands of charging points across the country,\u201d say the firms. It also means the telecoms providers are making the most of their existing assets. In Germany, Deutsche Telekom last year announced plans to convert 12,000 cabinets into charging stations.",

It needs a massive social media and billboard campaign committing to a people\u2019s vote</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yes, a big caveat is needed. Labour\u2019s leadership has few sympathisers in an overwhelmingly hostile press landscape. Those commentators feigning ignorance about the party\u2019s position \u2013 guffaw, guffaw, you need 15 paragraphs to explain Labour\u2019s policy! \u2013 are muddying the waters for partisan ends. Many of those ridiculing Labour for zigzagging and incoherence do not apply the same standard to the Liberal Democrats\u2019 absurd position, which now means revoking article 50 in the fantastical scenario that the party wins an election, or if not reverting back to support for a people\u2019s vote. Nor is Jo Swinson under sustained media pressure about whether she would prefer no deal to a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/corbyns-plan-to-lead-caretaker-government-unworkable-say-lib-dems\" title=\"\"> temporary Corbyn-led government</a> that would agree an extension then hold an election.</p> <p>But acknowledging unfair media treatment does not absolve Labour of mistakes. It should have adopted its current position unequivocally after the European elections in May. Now the policy is in place, the party isn\u2019t making the best of it.</p> <p>Explaining it is easy: messages such as, \u201cLabour will let the people decide, not the politicians\u201d; or \u201cOnly Labour trusts the people in a public vote\u201d. When shadow ministers are asked how they\u2019ll vote, they should answer the question \u2013 and indeed point out that most Labour MPs will campaign for remain \u2013 while saying it shouldn\u2019t be about politicians, who have done enough to inflame divisions; it should be about the people. Under a Labour government, the vote would be a choice between remain and a Brexit deal that doesn\u2019t blow up the economy and destroy hard-won rights \u2013 with no deal permanently taken off the table. Having a prime minister who isn\u2019t deliberately polarising the country, but attempting to heal divisions, should be presented as a virtue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/04/jeremy-corbyn-mps-labour-leader-legitimacy\">For those who want to stop no deal, Jeremy Corbyn is the only hope | Gary Younge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour ought to be on the front foot. It needs a massive social media and billboard campaign committing to a people\u2019s vote, public rallies, set-piece speeches by leading Labour politicians extolling the policy\u2019s virtues. At the moment, the position mostly emerges when a shadow cabinet minister is under sustained fire from a broadcast journalist who\u2019s defining it negatively. It is already subjected to laughs of ridicule from Question Time audiences. So unless Labour goes on the offensive over its policy, there will be lots more of these moments in the hothouse of an election campaign. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/02/labour-many-not-the-few-election-anti-elite\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories do have a clear message</a>, after all \u2013 \u201cget Brexit done\u201d appeals to a widespread sense of Brexit fatigue. The danger is that the Tory party is defining itself, while Labour is allowing itself to be defined by its opponents.</p> <p>There is an understandable fear among some Labour strategists that without winning over leave voters who did not opt for the party in 2017, the route to a majority is closed off. But there surely must be a sense of urgency over the fact that most of the support Labour has haemorrhaged is among remain voters who have flocked to the Lib Dems and, to a lesser degree, the Greens. Without them, Labour will be consigned to an electoral rout. As it is, those who prioritise Brexit taking place over everything else already consider support for a referendum as code for backing remain; the danger is many remain voters do not, while both regard the party as shifty.</p> <p>This is not to be fatalistic. In an election campaign, the stark choice \u2013 and the highest stakes since the second world war \u2013 will be far clearer than they are now. Labour will be able to present itself as the only party offering a pathway to remain, as well as offering a range of goodies \u2013 from scrapping tuition fees and tax justice to public ownership \u2013 that the Lib Dems will not.</p> <p>The unprecedented electoral fluidity of our time \u2013 and the experience of 2017 \u2013 means that any confident prediction about the election\u2019s outcome would be foolish. It is a winnable election for Labour \u2013 but without being far clearer and more confident about its own position, it risks imperilling its chances.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

It was, after all, the sole demand of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which \u2013 until three months ago \u2013 did not even officially back remain, just a referendum to end the impasse. But Labour is failing to communicate its stance clearly, fuelling a perception that the policy is a contorted mess when it actually isn\u2019t. Yes, a big caveat is needed. Labour\u2019s leadership has few sympathisers in an overwhelmingly hostile press landscape. Those commentators feigning ignorance about the party\u2019s position \u2013 guffaw, guffaw, you need 15 paragraphs to explain Labour\u2019s policy! \u2013 are muddying the waters for partisan ends. Many of those ridiculing Labour for zigzagging and incoherence do not apply the same standard to the Liberal Democrats\u2019 absurd position, which now means revoking article 50 in the fantastical scenario that the party wins an election, or if not reverting back to support for a people\u2019s vote. Nor is Jo Swinson under sustained media pressure about whether she would prefer no deal to a temporary Corbyn-led government that would agree an extension then hold an election. But acknowledging unfair media treatment does not absolve Labour of mistakes. It should have adopted its current position unequivocally after the European elections in May. Now the policy is in place, the party isn\u2019t making the best of it. Explaining it is easy: messages such as, \u201cLabour will let the people decide, not the politicians\u201d; or \u201cOnly Labour trusts the people in a public vote\u201d. When shadow ministers are asked how they\u2019ll vote, they should answer the question \u2013 and indeed point out that most Labour MPs will campaign for remain \u2013 while saying it shouldn\u2019t be about politicians, who have done enough to inflame divisions; it should be about the people. Under a Labour government, the vote would be a choice between remain and a Brexit deal that doesn\u2019t blow up the economy and destroy hard-won rights \u2013 with no deal permanently taken off the table. Having a prime minister who isn\u2019t deliberately polarising the country, but attempting to heal divisions, should be presented as a virtue. Labour ought to be on the front foot. It needs a massive social media and billboard campaign committing to a people\u2019s vote, public rallies, set-piece speeches by leading Labour politicians extolling the policy\u2019s virtues. At the moment, the position mostly emerges when a shadow cabinet minister is under sustained fire from a broadcast journalist who\u2019s defining it negatively. It is already subjected to laughs of ridicule from Question Time audiences. So unless Labour goes on the offensive over its policy, there will be lots more of these moments in the hothouse of an election campaign. Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories do have a clear message, after all \u2013 \u201cget Brexit done\u201d appeals to a widespread sense of Brexit fatigue. The danger is that the Tory party is defining itself, while Labour is allowing itself to be defined by its opponents. There is an understandable fear among some Labour strategists that without winning over leave voters who did not opt for the party in 2017, the route to a majority is closed off. But there surely must be a sense of urgency over the fact that most of the support Labour has haemorrhaged is among remain voters who have flocked to the Lib Dems and, to a lesser degree, the Greens. Without them, Labour will be consigned to an electoral rout. As it is, those who prioritise Brexit taking place over everything else already consider support for a referendum as code for backing remain; the danger is many remain voters do not, while both regard the party as shifty. This is not to be fatalistic. In an election campaign, the stark choice \u2013 and the highest stakes since the second world war \u2013 will be far clearer than they are now. Labour will be able to present itself as the only party offering a pathway to remain, as well as offering a range of goodies \u2013 from scrapping tuition fees and tax justice to public ownership \u2013 that the Lib Dems will not. The unprecedented electoral fluidity of our time \u2013 and the experience of 2017 \u2013 means that any confident prediction about the election\u2019s outcome would be foolish. It is a winnable election for Labour \u2013 but without being far clearer and more confident about its own position, it risks imperilling its chances. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Later models came with a 40kWh battery. The bigger the number, the higher the number of miles you\u2019ll get per charge.</p> <p>The early cars will typically manage 75 miles between plug-ins. The 30kWh cars will manage more than 100 miles, while the newer used models promise 150.</p> <p>The general rule is the bigger the capacity, the higher the purchase price. Buyers who drive 25 miles to work and back will be more than happy with the lower-capacity models which are the cheapest to buy.

Buyers have to factor in the battery lease payments \u2013 typically \u00a349-\u00a359 a month \u2013 which at least ensure you will always have a top-notch battery.</p> <p>The cost of an overnight charge that delivers a typical 100 miles of driving is about \u00a33-\u00a34 depending on your electricity tariff. A fast charge at a motorway service area or other area typically costs a Leaf owner about \u00a34-\u00a36 depending on battery size. A \u00a36 charge in a 40kWh car should deliver close to 150 miles.</p> <p>To go the same distance in a petrol car would typically cost \u00a324 \u2013 more if your journeys are all around congested towns.</p> <p>The fact that there are zero exhaust emissions means you can jump in the car to drive across town with a much clearer conscience.</p> <h2>What if you want a new car?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3085452897c23960ee1d1fa9b4bec824f61f829b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3085452897c23960ee1d1fa9b4bec824f61f829b/0_50_4318_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kia e-Niro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kia e-Niro car can be bought for about \u00a333,000, but most people will lease it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Destefanis/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you are in the market for a new electric car, Auto Express has rated the Kia e-Niro as \u201cpound for pound\u201d the best electric car on sale.</p> <p>Its testers had the 64kWh five-door model for more than 10,000 miles and named the Kia e-Niro \u201ca great family car that happens to be electric\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s better to drive than many petrol cars, is way cheaper to run and is a fuss-free joy to live with.

When using Kia\u2019s super-fast 100kW chargers, they said they were able to add about 150 miles of range in 30 minutes of charging.</p> <p>This car can be bought for about \u00a333,000, but most people will want to lease it. Deals vary but Lingscars, usually one of the cheapest around, will rent you one for the short term of two years for an upfront payment of \u00a31,770 and 23 further monthly payments of \u00a3590 a month. That allows the user to drive 10,000 miles a year.</p> <p>For comparison, the more conventional Kia Niro hybrid estate can be leased for four years at Lingscars for \u00a3278 a month with a first payment \u00a3834. But you\u2019ll have to factor in the fuel bills on top.</p> <p>A basic Mondeo can be leased for almost the same prices \u2013 again over four years. Note two-year deals tend to be pricier than traditional four-year terms.</p> <p>If the Kia doesn\u2019t do it for you and you have set your heart on the Tesla Model 3, a three-year personal lease will cost you \u00a3445 a month \u2013 but you have to put down a hefty \u00a34,000 upfront payment. You are restricted to 8,000 miles a year.</p> <p>As you\u2019d expect, the \u201caffordable\u201d Tesla has more wow factor than the Kia, but it is not as practical. It should deliver a real world range of 180-200 miles between charges \u2013 less than the Kia.</p> <p>Lingscars will also rent you an electric VW Golf for \u00a3230 a month for three years with an upfront cost of \u00a32,070. A top model that is on its way is the Hyundai Kona Electric 64kWh. With a real-life range of 259 miles, What Car said it was the best performing car it has tested so far.

The road tax is free and the savings on fuel are phenomenal. I used to drive a Ford Mondeo diesel, so this is a much greener option, one that I have not regretted for a moment.\u201d</p> <p>She has a 7kWh charger at home that will give her a decent charge in about three hours, or a full charge overnight. The car was leased on a three-year contract and she has the option to buy it at the end of the term.</p> <p>She thinks she may be an unusual electric car user in that she has never had to use a public charger, purely she says, because she can currently get everywhere she needs to go on a full charge.</p> <p>\u201cThe only downside I can think of is that the Leaf doesn\u2019t have as big a boot as my old Ford. I particularly love the heated steering wheel which might sound odd but it has been great for me as as I suffer poor circulation. I like the fact that Nissan gives you the option to hire a petrol car for two weeks a year if you need to make a longer trip. I may use that next year, but so far the Leaf has more than managed all I have thrown at it,\u201d she says.</p>",

It makes particular sense if you are one of the millions of people who use their car most days. Long considered way out of the price range of normal car buyers, good quality electric cars that were launched a few years ago, are now hitting the used market for less than \u00a37,000. Nissan Leafs, which cost \u00a330,000 (after grants) eight years ago, can be found for \u00a35,700 with about 60,000 miles on the clock.

The likes of We Are EV or JustEVs are not tied into one brand as traditional dealers tend to be, but will sell all makes.

The bigger the number, the higher the number of miles you\u2019ll get per charge. The early cars will typically manage 75 miles between plug-ins. The 30kWh cars will manage more than 100 miles, while the newer used models promise 150. The general rule is the bigger the capacity, the higher the purchase price. Buyers who drive 25 miles to work and back will be more than happy with the lower-capacity models which are the cheapest to buy. If you need a bigger range, you\u2019ll need a bigger battery size. A Zoe is considered the cheapest way to get a used electric car. Buyers have to factor in the battery lease payments \u2013 typically \u00a349-\u00a359 a month \u2013 which at least ensure you will always have a top-notch battery. The cost of an overnight charge that delivers a typical 100 miles of driving is about \u00a33-\u00a34 depending on your electricity tariff. A fast charge at a motorway service area or other area typically costs a Leaf owner about \u00a34-\u00a36 depending on battery size. A \u00a36 charge in a 40kWh car should deliver close to 150 miles. To go the same distance in a petrol car would typically cost \u00a324 \u2013 more if your journeys are all around congested towns. The fact that there are zero exhaust emissions means you can jump in the car to drive across town with a much clearer conscience. What if you want a new car? If you are in the market for a new electric car, Auto Express has rated the Kia e-Niro as \u201cpound for pound\u201d the best electric car on sale. Its testers had the 64kWh five-door model for more than 10,000 miles and named the Kia e-Niro \u201ca great family car that happens to be electric\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s better to drive than many petrol cars, is way cheaper to run and is a fuss-free joy to live with. I absolutely love it,\u201d was the testers\u2019 final verdict. Its testers found it would deliver a real-life range of 200-300 miles per full charge depending on the weather \u2013 it was at the lower end in the coldest months. When using Kia\u2019s super-fast 100kW chargers, they said they were able to add about 150 miles of range in 30 minutes of charging. This car can be bought for about \u00a333,000, but most people will want to lease it. Deals vary but Lingscars, usually one of the cheapest around, will rent you one for the short term of two years for an upfront payment of \u00a31,770 and 23 further monthly payments of \u00a3590 a month. That allows the user to drive 10,000 miles a year. For comparison, the more conventional Kia Niro hybrid estate can be leased for four years at Lingscars for \u00a3278 a month with a first payment \u00a3834. But you\u2019ll have to factor in the fuel bills on top. A basic Mondeo can be leased for almost the same prices \u2013 again over four years. Note two-year deals tend to be pricier than traditional four-year terms. If the Kia doesn\u2019t do it for you and you have set your heart on the Tesla Model 3, a three-year personal lease will cost you \u00a3445 a month \u2013 but you have to put down a hefty \u00a34,000 upfront payment. You are restricted to 8,000 miles a year. As you\u2019d expect, the \u201caffordable\u201d Tesla has more wow factor than the Kia, but it is not as practical. It should deliver a real world range of 180-200 miles between charges \u2013 less than the Kia. Lingscars will also rent you an electric VW Golf for \u00a3230 a month for three years with an upfront cost of \u00a32,070. A top model that is on its way is the Hyundai Kona Electric 64kWh. With a real-life range of 259 miles, What Car said it was the best performing car it has tested so far. Leases on this model are coming soon. \u2018The car has more than managed all I have thrown at it\u2019 Like most other people who have an electric car, Vicky Wyer says she could never go back to a diesel car. The landscape designer, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, says she has \u201cabsolutely loved\u201d her Nissan Leaf over the 18 months she has had it. \u201cI use it to drive the 45 minutes (30 miles) to work, three times a week and easily get there and back on a full charge. I have the mid-sized (30kWh) version that gives me a real world range of about 100 miles, and I have to say, it has been a revelation. \u201cIt\u2019s nippy, reliable, super comfortable, and will carry four people easily. The road tax is free and the savings on fuel are phenomenal. I used to drive a Ford Mondeo diesel, so this is a much greener option, one that I have not regretted for a moment.\u201d She has a 7kWh charger at home that will give her a decent charge in about three hours, or a full charge overnight. The car was leased on a three-year contract and she has the option to buy it at the end of the term. She thinks she may be an unusual electric car user in that she has never had to use a public charger, purely she says, because she can currently get everywhere she needs to go on a full charge. \u201cThe only downside I can think of is that the Leaf doesn\u2019t have as big a boot as my old Ford. I particularly love the heated steering wheel which might sound odd but it has been great for me as as I suffer poor circulation. I like the fact that Nissan gives you the option to hire a petrol car for two weeks a year if you need to make a longer trip. I may use that next year, but so far the Leaf has more than managed all I have thrown at it,\u201d she says.",

      "bodyText": "Name: Stephanie Conway Age: 29 Income: About \u00a31,700 a month Occupation: Digital marketing I booked a \u00a3300, one-way plane ticket from the UK to Bali in May. I didn\u2019t tell my family I was leaving at first as I was worried it might seem irrational. My aim was to build a life for myself on my own terms, and I knew my skills \u2013 helping small businesses and entrepreneurs with their marketing \u2013 were transferable. Now, I\u2019m working in Umalas, with lots of other expats, and using it as a base to travel around \u2013 my parents are still in shock that I\u2019ve gone. My rent is free as I set up a website and run a blog for the resort where I live \u2013 it would be \u00a3400 a month otherwise. I have friends staying in places for \u00a3100 a month but they don\u2019t have hot showers. My outgoings are about \u00a3200 a month. Food is my biggest expense at \u00a370 a month \u2013 especially if I eat in touristy restaurants and buy things like imported cheese. I spend \u00a330 on surfing, \u00a330 on socialising, \u00a310 on my phone and \u00a310 on petrol for my scooter to get around the island. Before starting my business, I bought a new MacBook, which was \u00a3800. Now, I\u2019m earning more and spending less than I was in the UK. Back home, I was on \u00a318,000 a year at a small marketing company near my home in Cumbria, working with influencers, helping them make a ton of money to travel. Their social media feeds showed them living their best lives on beaches while I was stuck in an office. It made me think: \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be where they are?\u201d I was spoiled as I had been in America for nine years. I left the UK when I was 18 to do an acting degree at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Los Angeles. My mum had pulled together half the $6,000-a-year fees (\u00a34,800), and I got a scholarship for the rest, making ends meet by working part time. I had really minor, walk-on parts on iCarly and Glee \u2013 as a cheerleader; a glorified extra. After graduating, I had the realisation that everyone in Los Angeles \u2013 your barista, your Uber driver, anyone who had a cash-in-hand job \u2013 was a budding actor. You can smell the desperation in the air. I read the first chapter of Think And Grow Rich, and decided I wanted to be on the business side of things instead of acting. I worked for top talent agencies, with global brands, doing film festivals including Sundance and Cannes, press junkets and red carpet events. Then, in 2018 my aunt died, and it felt like the right time to go home. It was a shock to return to Cockermouth \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful, but there\u2019s not much to do. I got a new job, but I started having problems. After living in constant sunshine, the Cumbrian winter weather slowed me down. I woke up in darkness to go to work, then came home as the sun was setting. I felt like a vampire. That was the final straw. I felt there had to be more to life. I knew I could do my job from anywhere with my laptop. So why should I be miserable? Bali has been a great place to start my business Symphonyva.com as I have such a minimal spend, and I don\u2019t have the pressure of figuring out how to pay rent and bills. My financial safety net is my \u00a310,000 savings. I invest \u00a3200 a month in a help-to-buy Isa that I\u2019ll eventually use to buy a home in the UK. I also invest \u00a3250 a month in premium bonds. In England, I had the pressure of needing to wear expensive clothes. But now it\u2019s so hot I\u2019ll wear a bikini and a top, so I don\u2019t need nice outfits. Living here, I\u2019ve seen intense poverty, and it\u2019s had a profound effect on my spending habits. There\u2019s so much plastic littering the beaches that it keeps me from buying any single-use plastics, knowing the damage it causes. But I do have more of a sense of guilt now. If I\u2019m going to the beach for the day, I think perhaps I should be working on a project instead. When I turn 30, I plan to open a retirement savings account and start looking to the future. I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to building up my business and moving back to England. But for now, I\u2019ve committed myself to learning how to surf every day, because I\u2019m really bad at it and I want to get better. Otherwise, what would be the point of living right by the sea in Indonesia?",

Caroline was keen, because she worried about taking too much time away from her career; but the family\u2019s wish to share her leave soon hit bureaucratic, financial and cultural brick walls.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you want to stay at home?\u201d Paul remembers incredulous male colleagues asking. Application forms for SPL were not circulated alongside those for maternity or paternity leave, and the human resources department was unhelpful. Sharing the leave would also have made the family poorer; Caroline earns more than Paul, and her employer\u2019s maternity package is relatively generous. Had she transferred a chunk of it to Paul under SPL, it would have dropped to the statutory minimum of \u00a3148.68 a week.</p> <p>Two weeks after the birth of his son, Paul went back to the factory. \u201cIt was bad. I felt really down,\u201d he says. \u201cI missed my boy.\u201d Caroline resented it, too. As well as managing life-changing new circumstances at home alone, she later had to pass up a promotion that would have clashed with the end of her maternity leave.</p> <p>SPL, which seemed so progressive at its launch, has turned out to be messier than a toddler\u2019s dinner. It began as an alternative to maternity leave, which, at the statutory minimum, entitles a mother to 52 weeks off work, 39 of which are paid (90% of earnings for six weeks, then \u00a3148.68 for 33 weeks), and paternity leave (two weeks at \u00a3148.68 per week). Under SPL, a mother must take two weeks of maternity leave after the birth, but can move to SPL for the remaining 50 weeks, 37 of which are paid. A couple can share those 50 weeks, either taking half in turn \u2013 alternating blocks, or, say, 25 weeks together.</p> <p>The criteria for claiming include a minimum length of employment with the same company and an eight-week notice period. (Agency, contract workers or the self-employed are not eligible.) Employers are required to grant shared leave to eligible staff who apply for it, and pay them, reclaiming it from the government by way of reduced national insurance contributions. Got it?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dads are still expected to see work as the priority. Many are given grunt jobs for daring to challenge the norms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the Roberts found, the complexity of SPL has been part of the reason parents aren\u2019t rushing to take it \u2013 and employers aren\u2019t racing to offer it. Earlier this year, the government launched a \u00a31.5m \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-share-the-joy-campaign-promotes-shared-parental-leave-rights-for-parents\" title=\"\">share the joy</a>\u201d campaign in an attempt to boost uptake of as little as 2%. Meanwhile, research published in August by the law firm EMW, based on claims filed by businesses with HMRC, suggests that <a href=\"http://hrnews.co.uk/less-than-a-third-of-eligible-men-now-take-any-paternity-leave-percentage-declines-for-fourth-year-in-a-row/\" title=\"\">less than a third</a> of fathers take statutory two-week paid paternity leave, a figure that is in decline.</p> <p>\u201cFor the modern generation, fatherhood is being expressed in totally different ways from before,\u201d says Han-Son Lee, a digital marketer whose experience (he struggled to get decent leave when he became a father) partly inspired him to launch the parenting website <a href=\"https://www.daddilife.com/\" title=\"\">DaddiLife</a>. \u201cBut the vast majority of workplaces haven\u2019t caught up, and dads are still expected to follow the stereotype of being at work is the priority.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners describe a vicious cycle; even well-intentioned couples submit to a deterrent climate, unwittingly perpetuating low expectations and poor policy. In workplaces, men are too often tacitly or explicitly discouraged from taking leave. \u201cAnd so many dads are given grunt work for daring to challenge norms,\u201d Lee adds. One anonymous father recalls the macho congratulations his colleague at a bank received on returning to his desk the day after leaving the labour ward.</p> <p>When David Freed was an economist in the public sector in London, he had no problem arranging shared leave when he and his wife, Charlotte, had a son in 2016. Charlotte took five months off her job in finance, after which David took seven months. He felt lucky, but noticed a change when he got back. \u201cI got the message I was doing something a bit weird, that might affect my career,\u201d Freed says. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018When you became a dad, your priorities seemed to lie elsewhere.\u2019 Well, yeah, but when I was at work, I was at work. Nothing had changed.\u201d</p> <p>Bad policy has far-reaching implications. Earlier this year, researchers from Georgetown University in Washington DC <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/gender-equality-at-home-takes-a-hit-when-children-arrive-118420\" title=\"\">studied</a> the way having children \u201ctraditionalised\u201d couples\u2019 division of labour, delaying the \u201csecond half\u201d of the gender revolution \u2013 in the home \u2013 long after women have made huge advances in education and the workforce. Even in countries with SPL, women still do more in the home when children arrive. Only one policy appeared to nudge the balance: a form of enhanced paternity leave known as \u201ca father\u2019s quota\u201d \u2013 a chunk of leave that a couple loses unless the father takes it. Among the couples in the study of 35 countries, 28% practised a modern division of labour without the father\u2019s quota, and 34% with it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2be045f623574a25861b9f53e6de2009c28e37e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be045f623574a25861b9f53e6de2009c28e37e3/0_1090_4480_3541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author David Freed with his wife, Charlote, and their son\" width=\"1000\" height=\"790\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freed with his wife, Charlotte, and their son: \u2018In Sweden, there are probably more dads out with babies than mums.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Schori/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just over a year ago, Freed and his family left the UK after Charlotte got a job in Sweden, a father\u2019s quota trailblazer. Today, couples in Sweden have one leave policy.

Within that total, each parent has a use-or-lose quota of 90 days. The remaining 300 days of the 480-day total can be shared. As a result, fathers have been taking steadily bigger chunks of the total leave period \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.se/20180117/dads-in-sweden-took-more-paternity-leave-in-2017\" title=\"\">up to </a><a href=\"https://www.thelocal.se/20180117/dads-in-sweden-took-more-paternity-leave-in-2017\" title=\"\">27.9%</a> in 2017.</p> <p>Quotas, versions of which exist in Norway and Iceland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/10/sweden-parental-leave-corporate-pressure-men-work\" title=\"\">have critics</a>, and gender gaps persist in these countries; but they have transformed family life, from the playground up. \u201cDuring the week, there are probably more dads out with babies than mums,\u201d Freed says. In workplaces, it is assumed that new fathers will disappear for months, not days. Freed was amazed to observe parents routinely dashing from meetings to nursery pick-ups at 3.30pm \u2013 without judgment. If there is a culture of presenteeism in Sweden, it exists at home, not work.</p> <p>Freed, whose experience in England inspired him to write <a href=\"https://freeassociationpublishing.com/\" title=\"\">Dads Don\u2019t Babysit: Towards Equal Parenting</a>, alongside fellow frustrated father James Millar, has noticed Swedish dads are better at sharing child-rearing responsibilities as well as day-to-day duties.

The gaps never close, partly because mothers are much more likely to work part-time, while families grapple with domestic logistics, childcare costs and the self-perpetuating pay gap itself \u2013 which means it tends to make financial sense for fathers to work more.</p> <p>The UK government at least recognises there is a problem, while also challenging its purported scale. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said in a statement that SPL uptake is in the range it estimated when it launched (2% to 8%). \u201cWe are consulting on options for how we may better balance the gender division of parental leave and pay,\u201d the statement added. That consultation, launched in July by Theresa May, envisages longer leave for dads. \u201cWe\u2019re not sending fathers the correct message when our current leave allowances give women 26 times more leave than men,\u201d the former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/18/family-fathers-paternity-leave-theresa-may\" title=\"\">wrote in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/18/family-fathers-paternity-leave-theresa-may\" title=\"\">the Guardian</a> at the time.</p> <p>Any improvements will need to catch up with a changing workforce. Dozens of companies are already acting.

Average paternity leave leapt from two to 21 weeks. Netflix, IBM and Twitter also have packages that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Stockholm.

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time, the BBC banned fascists from its broadcasts. In 1935, when Oswald Mosley\u2019s British Union was near its peak of popularity, organising rallies and marches across the country, the corporation stopped allowing him to appear on its programmes. The ban, unofficially supported by successive Conservative, Labour and coalition governments, lasted 33 years. Its rationale was straightforward: Mosley\u2019s views were too extreme, his supporters too threatening, and his admiration for foreign authoritarians too strong for him to be allowed a prominent place in the national discourse. A line was drawn between what was acceptable and unacceptable in rightwing politics, and Mosley was on the wrong side of it. By the time the prohibition was lifted, in 1968, he was a bitter old man.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/01/centrist-politics-boris-johnson-rightwing-populism\">Centrist politics will not defeat Boris Johnson\u2019s rightwing populism | Chantal Mouffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s impossible to imagine such a sustained and effective ban on a big far-right figure being imposed in Britain now. Many of our politicians and much of our media have stopped setting, let alone policing, any boundaries between mainstream conservatism and rightwing populism and extremism. The BBC seems reluctant to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/25/bbcs-naga-munchetty-reprimanded-over-trump-criticism\" title=\"\">characterise Donald Trump as a racist</a>. Nigel Farage, despite never having been elected as an MP, has been a panellist on BBC One\u2019s Question Time <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/nigel-farage-brexit-party-bbc-question-time-8905966\" title=\"\">33 times</a>.

Meanwhile Boris Johnson, and many of his ministers, party members and newspaper allies, have adopted the boot-boy phrases and demagoguery of the far right. As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/priti-patel-unveils-county-lines-crackdown\" title=\"\">home secretary, Priti Patel</a>, told a thrilled Conservative party conference this week: \u201cTo the criminals, I simply say this: we are coming after you.\u201d A stronger law-and-order state, she said, \u201cis what the people want\u201d.</p> <p>Sometimes, the bursting out of rightwing populism from the margins of our politics to its centre happens right in front of our eyes. Recently I went to a protest outside Downing Street against the prorogation of parliament. As the afternoon\u2019s speeches ground on, and children holding remain placards next to proud parents began to look a bit bored, a counter-protest by far-right Brexit supporters, mostly middle-aged men with years of anger in their eyes, gradually built up around us. The police held most of these men back, but not all. Some of them walked among the remainers, shouting \u201ctraitors!\u201d in their faces, filming them and asking for their names. At the end of the afternoon, the police advised the remainers to leave together. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d they warned, \u201cwe cannot guarantee your safety.\u201d In broad daylight, at the heart of the capital, expressing liberal views in public had been made to feel quite frightening. Mosley would have been proud.</p> <p>The endless Brexit confrontation has become a perfect environment for nationalists and xenophobes, for people offering short cuts past our stuck democracy. But the origins of this tilt towards the far right lie further in the past: in a calmer, more comfortable period of British politics, when a deep complacency set in.</p> <p>During the 90s and 00s, the fear of fascism that had hung over British politics through the mid-20th century finally faded to almost nothing. Partly, it was the passage of time: Tory and Labour cabinets, and the electorate, were no longer full of people who had fought Hitler. Yet there was also a change in how politicians thought about extremism. Centrists such as Tony Blair defined themselves very clearly against what they called \u201cthe hard left\u201d, and later against Islamic radicalism; they talked much less about the far right.</p> <p>Many New Labour ministers and thinkers, convinced that politics was becoming milder and less ideological, possibly for good, paid relatively little attention to the fierce rightwing populism that had begun building across Europe. They saw it as a political dead end: part of what Blair belittled as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/oct/03/labourconference.labour2\" title=\"\">the forces of conservatism</a>\u201d, which would ultimately be overcome by \u201cthe forces of progress\u201d. This disdain towards the populist right was passed on to Blair\u2019s Conservative admirers. In 2006, months after being elected as a liberalising Tory leader, David Cameron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/04/conservatives.uk\" title=\"\">described Ukip</a> as \u201ca bunch of fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64098e87e4343dec69b2344e2688d046927d10f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64098e87e4343dec69b2344e2688d046927d10f2/0_163_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Walter Walker in 1955\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sir Walter Walker tried to set up a private army in the turbulent mid-70s.\u2019 Walker in 1955. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This confidence in moderation was bolstered by an assumption, so widely and strongly held as to rarely need stating, that Britain simply didn\u2019t do fascism. Mosley was just a historical blip, this argument ran; his failure to establish a dictatorship or even a lasting movement, in contrast to the far right\u2019s huge impact elsewhere in 30s Europe, was proof of Britons\u2019 political good sense. Meanwhile, more recent would-be British strongmen were not even footnotes in most histories of modern Britain. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/aug/14/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Sir Walter Walker</a> was a retired general who tried to set up a private army during the turbulent mid-70s. \u201cThe country might choose rule by the gun in preference to anarchy,\u201d he told the London Evening News in July 1974. In 2002, when I included a chapter on him <a href=\"https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571215478-pinochet-in-piccadilly.html\" title=\"\">in a book</a> about British Conservatism\u2019s intermittent flirtations with authoritarianism, Jeremy Paxman languidly dismissed my excited discoveries on Radio 4\u2019s Start the Week. Wasn\u2019t I taking the whole Walker episode, he suggested, much too seriously?</p> <p>Yet during the 00s and 2010s the Blair and Cameron governments began to feed and legitimise some of the far right\u2019s preoccupations: New Labour by using the recklessly loaded phrase \u201cbogus asylum seekers\u201d, the Conservatives by declaring they would drastically cut total immigration. Meanwhile, journalists noticed that the British National party (BNP) was gaining seats in local and European elections. In a more competitive, less deferential media age than the one that accepted the Mosley ban, far-right figures became irresistible invitees for current affairs shows. In 2009, the leader of the BNP, Nick Griffin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/23/bnp-nick-griffin-question-time\" title=\"\">appeared on Question Time</a>.</p> <p>Many people were outraged. Yet to watch the programme now \u2013 to see Griffin defensive and flustered, rushing through his crude arguments while under constant attack by the audience, the host David Dimbleby, and the other panellists \u2013 is to see a time when rightwing populism was still relatively marginal and under-confident in Britain: not quite media-ready. We live in a different country now.</p> <p>To marginalise the far right again will be a huge task. In the past few weeks, Britain\u2019s many centrist MPs have finally made a start, by calling out thuggish language, and standing up for parliamentary democracy and the rule of law. And the hard right\u2019s decision to associate itself so closely with Brexit may backfire if Britain actually leaves the EU, and the result is an anticlimax or a disaster. So far, Brexit has been a largely rhetorical project, and rhetoric is the area of politics where ranters and dreamers are most comfortable.</p> <p>But even if Brexit ultimately damages them and their Tory imitators, they will find other grievances \u2013 multiculturalism, non-EU immigration \u2013 to keep their movement growing. To avoid aiding them, establishment politicians and journalists may even have to stop giving a voice to far-right figures who exploit confrontations with liberals \u2013 in other words, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/26/do-no-platform-policies-threaten-free-speech-at-uni-students-share-their-views\" title=\"\">no-platforming</a>, a tactic for which the left is usually condemned. In Mosley\u2019s autobiography, written during the fourth decade of his BBC ban, he complains: \u201cI have been the subject of frequent comment and attack, but \u2026 have always been denied the right to reply.\u201d How sweet that frustration sounds now.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the Guardian and author of Promised You a Miracle: Why 1980-82 Made Modern Britain</p>",

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time, the BBC banned fascists from its broadcasts. In 1935, when Oswald Mosley\u2019s British Union was near its peak of popularity, organising rallies and marches across the country, the corporation stopped allowing him to appear on its programmes. The ban, unofficially supported by successive Conservative, Labour and coalition governments, lasted 33 years. Its rationale was straightforward: Mosley\u2019s views were too extreme, his supporters too threatening, and his admiration for foreign authoritarians too strong for him to be allowed a prominent place in the national discourse. A line was drawn between what was acceptable and unacceptable in rightwing politics, and Mosley was on the wrong side of it. By the time the prohibition was lifted, in 1968, he was a bitter old man. It\u2019s impossible to imagine such a sustained and effective ban on a big far-right figure being imposed in Britain now. Many of our politicians and much of our media have stopped setting, let alone policing, any boundaries between mainstream conservatism and rightwing populism and extremism. The BBC seems reluctant to characterise Donald Trump as a racist. Nigel Farage, despite never having been elected as an MP, has been a panellist on BBC One\u2019s Question Time 33 times. Tommy Robinson has been interviewed on BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight. Meanwhile Boris Johnson, and many of his ministers, party members and newspaper allies, have adopted the boot-boy phrases and demagoguery of the far right. As the home secretary, Priti Patel, told a thrilled Conservative party conference this week: \u201cTo the criminals, I simply say this: we are coming after you.\u201d A stronger law-and-order state, she said, \u201cis what the people want\u201d. Sometimes, the bursting out of rightwing populism from the margins of our politics to its centre happens right in front of our eyes. Recently I went to a protest outside Downing Street against the prorogation of parliament. As the afternoon\u2019s speeches ground on, and children holding remain placards next to proud parents began to look a bit bored, a counter-protest by far-right Brexit supporters, mostly middle-aged men with years of anger in their eyes, gradually built up around us. The police held most of these men back, but not all. Some of them walked among the remainers, shouting \u201ctraitors!\u201d in their faces, filming them and asking for their names. At the end of the afternoon, the police advised the remainers to leave together. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d they warned, \u201cwe cannot guarantee your safety.\u201d In broad daylight, at the heart of the capital, expressing liberal views in public had been made to feel quite frightening. Mosley would have been proud. The endless Brexit confrontation has become a perfect environment for nationalists and xenophobes, for people offering short cuts past our stuck democracy. But the origins of this tilt towards the far right lie further in the past: in a calmer, more comfortable period of British politics, when a deep complacency set in. During the 90s and 00s, the fear of fascism that had hung over British politics through the mid-20th century finally faded to almost nothing. Partly, it was the passage of time: Tory and Labour cabinets, and the electorate, were no longer full of people who had fought Hitler. Yet there was also a change in how politicians thought about extremism. Centrists such as Tony Blair defined themselves very clearly against what they called \u201cthe hard left\u201d, and later against Islamic radicalism; they talked much less about the far right. Many New Labour ministers and thinkers, convinced that politics was becoming milder and less ideological, possibly for good, paid relatively little attention to the fierce rightwing populism that had begun building across Europe. They saw it as a political dead end: part of what Blair belittled as \u201cthe forces of conservatism\u201d, which would ultimately be overcome by \u201cthe forces of progress\u201d. This disdain towards the populist right was passed on to Blair\u2019s Conservative admirers. In 2006, months after being elected as a liberalising Tory leader, David Cameron described Ukip as \u201ca bunch of fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists\u201d. This confidence in moderation was bolstered by an assumption, so widely and strongly held as to rarely need stating, that Britain simply didn\u2019t do fascism. Mosley was just a historical blip, this argument ran; his failure to establish a dictatorship or even a lasting movement, in contrast to the far right\u2019s huge impact elsewhere in 30s Europe, was proof of Britons\u2019 political good sense. Meanwhile, more recent would-be British strongmen were not even footnotes in most histories of modern Britain. Sir Walter Walker was a retired general who tried to set up a private army during the turbulent mid-70s. \u201cThe country might choose rule by the gun in preference to anarchy,\u201d he told the London Evening News in July 1974. In 2002, when I included a chapter on him in a book about British Conservatism\u2019s intermittent flirtations with authoritarianism, Jeremy Paxman languidly dismissed my excited discoveries on Radio 4\u2019s Start the Week. Wasn\u2019t I taking the whole Walker episode, he suggested, much too seriously? Yet during the 00s and 2010s the Blair and Cameron governments began to feed and legitimise some of the far right\u2019s preoccupations: New Labour by using the recklessly loaded phrase \u201cbogus asylum seekers\u201d, the Conservatives by declaring they would drastically cut total immigration. Meanwhile, journalists noticed that the British National party (BNP) was gaining seats in local and European elections. In a more competitive, less deferential media age than the one that accepted the Mosley ban, far-right figures became irresistible invitees for current affairs shows. In 2009, the leader of the BNP, Nick Griffin, appeared on Question Time. Many people were outraged. Yet to watch the programme now \u2013 to see Griffin defensive and flustered, rushing through his crude arguments while under constant attack by the audience, the host David Dimbleby, and the other panellists \u2013 is to see a time when rightwing populism was still relatively marginal and under-confident in Britain: not quite media-ready. We live in a different country now. To marginalise the far right again will be a huge task. In the past few weeks, Britain\u2019s many centrist MPs have finally made a start, by calling out thuggish language, and standing up for parliamentary democracy and the rule of law. And the hard right\u2019s decision to associate itself so closely with Brexit may backfire if Britain actually leaves the EU, and the result is an anticlimax or a disaster. So far, Brexit has been a largely rhetorical project, and rhetoric is the area of politics where ranters and dreamers are most comfortable. But even if Brexit ultimately damages them and their Tory imitators, they will find other grievances \u2013 multiculturalism, non-EU immigration \u2013 to keep their movement growing. To avoid aiding them, establishment politicians and journalists may even have to stop giving a voice to far-right figures who exploit confrontations with liberals \u2013 in other words, no-platforming, a tactic for which the left is usually condemned. In Mosley\u2019s autobiography, written during the fourth decade of his BBC ban, he complains: \u201cI have been the subject of frequent comment and attack, but \u2026 have always been denied the right to reply.\u201d How sweet that frustration sounds now. \u2022 Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the Guardian and author of Promised You a Miracle: Why 1980-82 Made Modern Britain",

It would be fair to say I\u2019ve neglected my work and family to pursue this idiotic task, for more than a week. In fact, I have spoken and thought of almost nothing else.\u201d</p> <p>It is the truth, but I do not like the way it makes me seem.</p> <p>I began the week by doing some research. It turns out that making YouTube tutorials about how to get the rust off an old iron pan is a pastime shared by a large number of men I wish I had slightly less in common with.</p> <p>The method that appeals to me most involves setting up a homemade electrolysis bath using bicarbonate of soda, two iron bars and a car battery recharger. But it looks dangerous, and would be, I think, a very unattractive way to die. There are simpler strategies.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is there a bucket full of brown stuff on the back step?\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Coca-Cola,\u201d I say. \u201cThe pan\u2019s in there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes that work?\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cNot so far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the shops,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you want anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cTwo gallons of vinegar.\u201d</p> <p>In between soakings I scrub the pan, but the rust mostly stays on. Rain dilutes the vinegar overnight, and it has to be replaced. I\u2019m getting nowhere.</p> <p>\u201cI need one of those things,\u201d I say to my wife on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a wire brush, but with a drill bit attached.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, for getting the rust off pans,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to throw that pan away,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The first shop I visit does not have any wire brushes with drill bits attached, or even a section where they might be. At the second shop, the man says he did have some, but they sold out. Suddenly everybody is trying to get rust off stuff.</p> <p>\u201cAny luck?\u201d my wife says when I return.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, setting two large jugs of vinegar on the table. \u201cBut there is definitely such a thing.\u201d</p> <p>The next afternoon a box arrives for me.</p> <p>\u201cWire brush drill bits,\u201d I say. \u201cA set of six.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/21/tim-dowling-how-long-does-it-take-to-be-broken-by-early-morning-alarm\">Tim Dowling: how long does it take to be broken by a 4.50am alarm?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHow much money have you sunk into this project so far?\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cEnough to buy a new iron pan,\u201d I say.</p> <p>I stick a wire brush on the drill, and take it out to the back step. I put a mask on and apply the brush to the pan. The noise is horrible. My teeth chatter. It takes several hours to scour the pan back to bare metal.</p> <p>\u201cNow what?\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cWe bake the pan,\u201d I say. \u201cThen we oil the pan.

In fact, I have spoken and thought of almost nothing else.\u201d It is the truth, but I do not like the way it makes me seem. I began the week by doing some research. It turns out that making YouTube tutorials about how to get the rust off an old iron pan is a pastime shared by a large number of men I wish I had slightly less in common with. The method that appeals to me most involves setting up a homemade electrolysis bath using bicarbonate of soda, two iron bars and a car battery recharger. But it looks dangerous, and would be, I think, a very unattractive way to die. There are simpler strategies. \u201cWhy is there a bucket full of brown stuff on the back step?\u201d my wife says. \u201cIt\u2019s Coca-Cola,\u201d I say. \u201cThe pan\u2019s in there.\u201d \u201cDoes that work?\u201d she says. \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cNot so far.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to the shops,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you want anything?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cTwo gallons of vinegar.\u201d In between soakings I scrub the pan, but the rust mostly stays on. Rain dilutes the vinegar overnight, and it has to be replaced. I\u2019m getting nowhere. \u201cI need one of those things,\u201d I say to my wife on Thursday. \u201cWhat things?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a wire brush, but with a drill bit attached.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, for getting the rust off pans,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw that pan away,\u201d she says. The first shop I visit does not have any wire brushes with drill bits attached, or even a section where they might be. At the second shop, the man says he did have some, but they sold out. Suddenly everybody is trying to get rust off stuff. \u201cAny luck?\u201d my wife says when I return. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, setting two large jugs of vinegar on the table. \u201cBut there is definitely such a thing.\u201d The next afternoon a box arrives for me. \u201cWire brush drill bits,\u201d I say. \u201cA set of six.\u201d \u201cHow much money have you sunk into this project so far?\u201d my wife says. \u201cEnough to buy a new iron pan,\u201d I say. I stick a wire brush on the drill, and take it out to the back step. I put a mask on and apply the brush to the pan. The noise is horrible. My teeth chatter. It takes several hours to scour the pan back to bare metal. \u201cNow what?\u201d my wife says. \u201cWe bake the pan,\u201d I say. \u201cThen we oil the pan. Then we bake the pan again. Then oil. I might need to stay up all night.\u201d \u201cChrist,\u201d my wife says. \u201cOpen all the windows. It\u2019s gonna get hot in here.\u201d Back at the wine shop, I am resisting the urge to explain all of this to Max. To be honest, if the other two men hadn\u2019t been there, I probably would have told him the whole thing.",

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders had a heart attack, his campaign confirmed Friday, as the Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate was released from the hospital. The 78-year-old was at a campaign event in Nevada on Tuesday when he experienced chest discomfort and was taken to a hospital. He was transferred to Desert Springs hospital medical center where doctors inserted two stents to open up a blocked artery in his heart, according to a statement from the Las Vegas doctors. The doctors said the rest of his arteries were normal. In a video posted to Twitter on Friday, Sanders said he was feeling \u201cso much better\u201d and thanked supporters for \u201cthe love and warm wishes you send me\u201d. A heart attack, which can be caused by a blocked artery, occurs when an area of the heart is suffering and in danger of damage because it\u2019s not getting enough blood or oxygen. On Saturday, Sanders left Las Vegas and was returning to Vermont. An artery-opening procedure like the one Sanders had, and placing stents, which act like tiny scaffolds to keep the artery open, restores blood flow and helps prevent future problems. The statements from Sanders and his doctors do not indicate whether his heart suffered any permanent damage, or the extent of any. The doctors said the rest of his stay before being discharged Friday was \u201cuneventful with good expected progress\u201d. The campaign also released a statement from Sanders in which he thanked the doctors, nurses and hospital staff. \u201cAfter two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work,\u201d he said. He is expected to return to Vermont and has said he plans to appear at the next Democratic debate, on 15 October. This marks the second time in two months that health problems forced Sanders to cancel campaign events. In September, he backed out of some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. His campaign said at the time that Sanders felt fine. As the oldest candidate in the Democratic 2020 field, Sanders has sometimes jokingly referenced his age on the campaign trail.
