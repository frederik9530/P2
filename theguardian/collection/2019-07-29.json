Wesfarmers \u2013 the giant parent of the $1.7bn-valued company \u2013 is playing down the big shift in the executive team for the industrial supplies business, despite changes to its CEO, CCO and CFO positions. Blackwoods sells tools and safety equipment as well as mining and engineering supplies. The company has more than 5,000 staff in 200 outlets across Australia. In late May, David Baxby, Wesfarmers industrials division managing director, announced that Peter Kelly, Blackwoods\u2019 CEO, would leave the company to \u201cpursue opportunities outside of Wesfarmers\u201d. In his message to staff, seen by Guardian Australia, Baxby said Kelly would be available in an advisory capacity until December, and \u201cleaves the business in a much better place than when he arrived\u201d. In his place was long-time Wesfarmers exec Rachael McVitty as interim CEO, and then ultimately CEO. On Thursday last week, McVitty emailed staff to say that Blackwoods\u2019 chief commercial officer James Pyne would be going on a \u201cone-year career break\u201d from 1 January 2020, with an intention he would return to Blackwoods in 2021. As a result of this responsibilities being split into other executives roles, McVitty said the company\u2019s chief financial officer Elodie Guillaumond was \u201cexploring role opportunities and options across the Wesfarmers group\u201d and in her place Michael Dixon would be the company\u2019s new CFO, coming from being CFO of Wesfarmers resources. A general manager and an executive assistant also had their roles made redundant and McVitty announced they would both leave the business. A spokesperson for Wesfarmers said the restructure was \u201cnot unusual\u201d with a new CEO coming into the business and while two general manager roles were removed, there were four new regional general manager jobs across Queensland, Western Australia, south-eastern Australia and NSW/ACT to shift the company\u2019s focus on regional sales.",

      "bodyText": "Nearly two fifths of 18-year-old applicants to university received an unconditional offer this year, according to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. The Ucas figures show a rise from last year, with 97,045 (38%) of would-be undergraduates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland receiving an offer with an unconditional component in 2019, compared with 87,540, or 34%, in 2018. A total of 257,910 18-year-old students from England, Northern Ireland and Wales applied for university through Ucas before the 30 June deadline this year. Unconditional offers are often offered to students whose qualifications are still pending, meaning their grades are predicted rather than achieved. A report published by Ucas in 2018, showed that students holding a confirmed place on an undergraduate were more likely to fall short of their predicted grades than those with conditional offers. Clare Marchant, the admissions organisation\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cStudents\u2019 best interests must be the number-one consideration for universities and colleges when making offers. \u201cThe use of unconditional offers remains a complex issue and continues to evolve. We look forward to working with the Office for Students and Universities UK on their respective upcoming admissions practice reviews, to deliver meaningful recommendations.\u201d The report also found that applicants from the most disadvantaged areas were 50% more likely to receive an unconditional offer than those from the most advantaged areas. A quarter of applicants from England, Northern Ireland and Wales who are 18, received a \u201cconditional unconditional\u201d offer, up from a fifth at this point last year. Conditional unconditional offers are initially made by universities as conditional \u2013 or dependent on the grades a student achieves \u2013 then updated to unconditional if the offer is accepted as the student\u2019s firm choice. Overall, 80% of 18-year-old applicants received an offer of either conditional, unconditional, or conditional unconditional in 2019. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cThere is a place for unconditional offers, however this data highlights the continued rise in their use and we know some students who accept unconditional offers can be more likely to miss their predicted A-level grades. \u201cWe also have particular concerns about the use of conditional unconditional offers, which can potentially pressure students into accepting a place which may not the best option for them.\u201d As most Scottish applicants already have Scottish Higher qualifications, which often form part of the entry requirements for university courses, they were not included in the analysis by Ucas. In January, statistics from the organisation showed that a small group of institutions relying heavily on unconditional offers to attract students were responsible for the sharp rise in their use.",

      "bodyText": "Progress in closing the GCSE attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their wealthier classmates has come to a standstill, signalling \u201ca major setback for social mobility\u201d, according to a report. The study by the Education Policy Institute thinktank found the gap, which has been gradually closing since 2011, widened slightly last year, with the most persistently disadvantaged pupils now almost two years (22.6 months) behind their peers by the time they finish their GCSEs. After six years of progress, the EPI said the government\u2019s own data showed that the average gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students by the end of secondary school went up from 17.9 months in 2017 to 18.1 months last year. Its annual report into the state of education in England acknowledged the changes were relatively modest, but said the shift in direction could mark a turning point which, if not addressed, could lead to the progress of recent years being reversed. The study, which based its analysis on attainment in GCSE English language and maths, found distinct geographical differences with the disadvantage gap larger \u2013 and growing \u2013 in parts of the north of England. In Rotherham and Blackpool, poorer pupils lagged behind their peers by more than two years on average by the time they finished their GCSEs. The smallest disadvantage gaps were in London. The report also looked at attainment by ethnic background and found black Caribbean pupils had slipped a further 2.2 months behind their white British peers since 2011. Pupils with the most severe special educational needs remained the furthest behind and were 40 months behind by the end of secondary school. David Laws, EPI\u2019s executive chairman, said the report should be \u201ca wake-up call\u201d for the new prime minister, Boris Johnson. \u201cWe are now witnessing a major setback for social mobility in our country.

However, primary schools were still narrowing the gap: disadvantaged pupils were 9.2 months behind their wealthier class mates when they left, down from 9.5 months in 2017.

      "body": "<h2>1.15pm update: conditions anything but glorious</h2> \n<p>Glorious Goodwood is due to start in 35 minutes and it has to be said that conditions on the top of the Sussex downs are anything but glorious at present. The forecast rain had held off for much of the morning but a downpour arrived a few minutes ago and the going, which was changed to good-to-firm, good in places from good all over this morning, is heading back in the opposite direction.</p> \n<p>Without an anemometer to hand, it is difficult to be certain about the strength of the wind but the forecast was for gusts of up to 40mph and I got quite a buffeting on the walk into the course. It will also be very much in the runners\u2019 faces as they run down the hill towards home, which could give a slight edge to those that can get a bit of cover \u2013 just as long as it isn\u2019t in that famous mobile pocket against the far rail.</p> \n<p>Betting has been relatively light so far but Soto Sizzler, who took the valuable 12-furlong handicap for three-year-olds on the second day here last year, is now top-priced at 6-1 for the opening race having been as big as 11-1 overnight. Stradivarius is a solid favourite to win the Goodwood Cup for the third year running at 8-11, but Cross Counter has been backed to beat him and is now top-priced at 3-1 from 7-2.</p> \n<h2>Tuesday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>Over 400 of Great Britain\u2019s roughly 450 licensed jockeys have yet to win a single race at Group One level. Frankie Dettori, by contrast, has won nine since the end of May and he will be a hot favourite to reach double figures when he rides Stradivarius in Tuesday\u2019s Goodwood Cup, the feature event on day one of Glorious Goodwood. Stradivarius pushed the betting industry towards a Dettori-driven meltdown when he took the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/20/frankie-dettori-wins-gold-cup-stradivarius-four-timer-royal-ascot-horse-racing\" title=\"\">taking his rider to four wins from four on the day</a>.</p> \n<p>No chances will be taken this time and John Gosden\u2019s five-year-old is expected to start odds-on at around 8-11 as he tries to take his current winning streak to eight. Stradivarius\u2019s backers may well find their heart-rate increasing sharply at some stage, as the favourite\u2019s average winning distance in his last six victories is a length. And while he has always managed to get the job done, Tuesday\u2019s track and trip will play to the strengths of a very dangerous opponent in <strong>Cross Counter (3.35)</strong>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/28/enable-may-bypass-york-head-straight-for-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-john-gosden-horse-racing\">Enable may head straight for Arc and career finale, hints Gosden</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup winner was only fourth in the Gold Cup, just under two lengths behind Stradivarius, but he was held up behind a steady pace on his first try at two and a half miles and could never land a serious blow. Back at two miles on a course where he broke the track record for one mile six furlongs last summer, he offers some real value against the favourite at around 7-2.</p> \n<p><strong>Goodwood 1.50</strong> The handicap that kicks off five days on the Sussex downs this week is fiercely competitive. Six of the runners lined up for the equally competitive John Smith\u2019s Cup at York earlier this month with Setting Sail, the favourite here at around 7-2, faring best in second place, but he is now 7lb worse off with <strong>Jazeel</strong>, who struggled for racing room on the Knavesmire. Jazeel has been in excellent form since joining Jedd O\u2019Keeffe at the start of the season and Jamie Spencer, a dab hand with hold-up horses, is the ideal rider to deliver him late off a strong pace.</p> \n<p><strong>Goodwood 2.25</strong> Some exceptional colts have announced themselves in the Vintage Stakes in recent years including Expert Eye, Galileo Gold and Highland Reel, and this looks like another strong renewal. Visinari could not justify the pre-race hype when only third in the July Stakes last time but he lost little in defeat, while Positive, Mystery Power and <strong>Pinatubo</strong>, who looked like a potential champion juvenile as he pulled three lengths clear in the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot, are all unbeaten.</p> \n<p><strong>Goodwood 3.00</strong> This may be a slightly sub-par renewal of the Lennox Stakes which could offer an opening for <strong>Flaming Spear</strong> to run well at big odds. He spreadeagled a big-field handicap off a rating of 104 over track and trip last summer and, though he has not run since November, he has often run well fresh in the past. At around 16-1 he is a big each-way price.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"15b0f70f-4b7f-4516-b2c8-6a320354b98a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Yarmouth</b>&nbsp;<b>1.40</b> Etikaal&nbsp;<b>2.15</b> Lilkian&nbsp;<b>2.50</b> Tigerfish&nbsp;<b>3.25</b> Knowing&nbsp;<br><b>4.00</b> Majaalis&nbsp;<b>4.30</b> Mitigator&nbsp;<b>5.05</b> George Dryden&nbsp;<br><br><b>Goodwood</b>&nbsp;<b>1.50</b> Jazeel (nap)&nbsp;<b>2.25</b> Pinatubo&nbsp;<b>3.00</b> Flaming Spear (nb)&nbsp;<br><b>3.30 </b>Cross Counter&nbsp;<b>4.10</b> Cobra Eye&nbsp;<b>4.45</b> Maygold&nbsp;<b>5.15</b> Salayel&nbsp;<br><br><b>Beverley</b>&nbsp;<b>2.05</b> Tell Me All&nbsp;<b>2.40</b> Siyahamba&nbsp;<b>3.15</b> Harry Love&nbsp;<b>3.50</b> Ginger Jam&nbsp;<b>4.20</b> How Bizarre&nbsp;<b>4.55</b> Barbarosa&nbsp;<b>5.30</b> John Caesar&nbsp;<br><br><b>Worcester</b>&nbsp;<b>5.35</b> Double Court&nbsp;<b>6.05</b> Raven's Touch&nbsp;<b>6.40</b> Twasn't The Plan&nbsp;<b>7.15</b> Jesse Jude&nbsp;<b>7.50</b> Takinitallin<b>&nbsp;8.20</b> Magical Thomas&nbsp;<b>8.50</b> Evita Du Mesnil&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Perth</b>&nbsp;<b>5.45</b> Purple King&nbsp;<b>6.15</b> Nietzche&nbsp;<b>6.50</b> Kashmir Wilde&nbsp;<b>7.25</b> Old Salt&nbsp;<br><b>8.00 </b>Putting Green&nbsp;<b>8.30</b> Chateau Robin&nbsp;<b>9.00</b> Artiste Celebre</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "A national review of how conservation laws affect the agriculture industry was prompted by a complaint on the radio from Richard Taylor \u2013 the brother of Angus Taylor \u2013 the former Nationals senator John Williams has said. Williams says he pushed for the farm-focused review after he heard Richard Taylor speaking about state and federal investigations into alleged illegal clearing of grasslands on land he and the energy minister part-own in New South Wales. Williams made the comments on Monday as the Senate prepared to vote down for a second time an inquiry into the conduct of Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg over the species at the centre of the investigation, the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. Labor\u2019s motion was lost by one vote. Labor and the Greens have been pushing for the inquiry following a Guardian Australia investigation which revealed Taylor met with senior environment officials and the office of the then environment minister Josh Frydenberg in 2017 to discuss the listing of the grasslands as critically endangered under national environment law. The meeting took place at the same time investigations were under way into whether the company Jam Land Pty Ltd illegally cleared land containing the grasses in the Monaro region of New South Wales. Richard Taylor is one of the director\u2019s of Jam Land and Angus Taylor himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. After Angus Taylor\u2019s lobbying, Frydenberg\u2019s office sought advice on whether protection of the grasslands could be watered down and if that change had to be published. In April 2018, Williams gave an interview in which he spoke about his \u201cdisgust\u201d at how farmers were being treated under federal environment law and how he was prompted to push for a review of the interaction between the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act and agriculture after speaking to Richard Taylor. The Craik review was launched last year and its final report was released last month. A case study of the grasslands at the centre of the Taylor case was included in the review. \u201cI was driving down the road and I was listening to the Country Hour,\u201d Williams told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey had Mr Taylor [Richard] on there saying he was facing charges under federal laws for spraying noxious weeds. \u201cI spoke to Mr Taylor [Richard] and said this is appalling. You\u2019re spraying serrated tussock and African lovegrass.\u201d Williams said he took the matter to the National party room and there was a meeting with the Nationals, Frydenberg and a representative for the Department of Environment and Energy. \u201cWe told Josh Frydenberg and Josh Frydenberg left that meeting in no doubt how disgusted we were,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe instigated a review and she [Craik] reported back months later.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Williams said he was not aware of Richard Taylor\u2019s relationship to Angus when he spoke to him and then pushed for the meeting. Williams could not recall the exact date of the meeting but said it was around 18 months ago. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this Mr Taylor was Angus Taylor\u2019s brother. I couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course the politics now is blame Angus, which I think is very unfair.\u201d Williams\u2019 hope from the agriculture review was that it would recommend a single set of environment laws that were managed by the states. He also wanted grasslands excluded entirely from protection under Australian environment law. The Craik review found that despite a perception environment laws were placing a burden on farmers, only 2.7% of referrals for environmental assessment under the EPBC Act were related to agriculture. The natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands has been protected under the EPBC Act since 2000. They were upgraded from endangered to critically endangered by the former environment minister Greg Hunt in 2016, but the requirement for federal assessment for certain levels of clearing had been in place for more than decade. In documents obtained under freedom of information, produced around the time Taylor was seeking briefings with officials in March 2017, a clearly exasperated bureaucrat explained to Frydenberg\u2019s office: \u201cThere is a perception of a significant burden, but the regulatory impact due to ecological community listings has historically been minor for individual landholders and the agriculture sector. \u201cMost EPBC Act referrals are for large projects in urban development, mining and other major infrastructure. There have been about 45 referrals for actions impacting the grasslands since 2000, mostly for windfarms and residential development around Canberra. There have been no referrals for agriculture in that time but there is one compliance case currently under investigation which covers a large area.\u201d The same briefing note said that the public consultation for the upgraded listing of the grasslands had been in excess of what was required under law and included emails to a \u201cwide range of stakeholders, including all councils, local land services, and state agencies where the ecological community occurs, and the National Farmers\u2019 Federation (NFF) and NSW Farmers\u2019 Association\u201d. \u201cThese farmers\u2019 groups were contacted by the department\u2019s environment liaison officer with the NFF, and the department met with the NFF to discuss the listing on multiple occasions,\u201d the department said.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for Love Island 2019 (until the reunion show a week on Sunday, obvs) and adios from the liveblog. Keep on grafting and don\u2019t be #chaldish, #isleneverforgetyou! \u201cMoney Mae\u201d is currently trending on Twitter in the UK, as fans imagine Molly-Mae\u2019s devastation at not winning the \u00a350k. How uncharitable - she was actually more excited about the prospect of being on This Morning. Remember that theory from earlier in the night about the winning couple standing to the right of Caroline? Well, Amber and Greg stood to her left. Don\u2019t believe everything you read, kids! It\u2019s over! Greg and Amber are leaving with \u00a325k each and, the one thing we all need more than ever: LOVE Greg steals the \u00a350k, rips off the mask ... it\u2019s been Michael here all along!!! The luck of the Irish!! ...but will he be on the winning or the losing team? Below the line, Hawkeye63 suggests that ITV \u201cshould do one for people over, say, 45. Slice of fried tv gold\u201d. Maybe they could get these lads to host?! Don\u2019t remind us about your cooking, Tommy!! \u201cYou\u2019re the girl I\u2019ve been looking for my entire life,\u201d says Tommy, ending a 20-year game of hide and seek As much as I love Amber and Greg, I\u2019ve seen a more \u201cinstant connection\u201d between my laptop and printer \u201cBefore we reveal the result .. let\u2019s play all the clips you\u2019ve already seen 400 times tonight!\u201d *whisper it* Nice to hear a mention of sweet, quirky, kimono-wearing Chris - Russell Brand and Nick Grimshaw\u2019s love child, surely destined to appear on Celebrity Juice once every 6 months and eventually date the Flack #isleneverforgetyou Below the line, DevonLoch1 suggests that ITV \u201cshould change the format so one could vote for individuals instead of couples. Curtis, Molly-Mae and India are dragging down their respective partners\u201d. So Devon, let me get this right, you want to do a dating show ... without the dating?! Blasphemy. ...and Ovie\u2019s sure to have a dazzlingly bright future. And, er, India too, obvs. \u201cIt\u2019s been highs, lows, lotta emotion\u201d says Curtis, who could be talking about LITERALLY ANYTHING While we wait, let\u2019s pour one out for Anton #isleneverforgetyou ...and Caroline has said \u201cdead ting\u201d, words which will hopefully never, ever leave her mouth again ...and Marvin #isleneverforgetyou Nice to see a mention of Joe in this recap, who - if this pic is anything to go by - now lives at a Premier Inn Hmmmmm.... what to think? \u201cThe island\u2019s amazing, India\u2019s amazing,\u201d says Ovie, either commenting on the final OR leaving a TripAdvisor review about his last holiday Greg wrote a poem (half) rhyming paddy with radgie! His mum bought Amber a shamrock! Get that \u00a350,000 out NOW. Flack told us to get our tissues ready - but she didn\u2019t warn us that we\u2019d need them for our collective projectile vomit at Curtis\u2019 speech Time for a quick #isleneverforgetyou part III - who could forget the moment when Michael finally got his comeuppance and lost both Joanna AND Amber. This series has seen a lot of awful behaviour from the boys - in particular, Michael, Danny (AKA The Travel Agent, such was his ability to get girls dumped from the island), and Jordan, who pied Amber, Yewande and Anna respectively. But none were arguably as bad as old Mike, who was so obsessed with calling other people immature that he failed to realise that he was in fact the most juvenile of them all. Frankly #chaldish Ad break! Time to plug the album one final time. It doesn\u2019t even seem that bad. Did I mention I ordered 6 water bottles? EVERYTHING suits Ovie. He could\u2019ve come out dressed as a Teletubbies character and we\u2019d still have been getting Tweets like this Tommy\u2019s just announced that he felt like the Prime Minister in his ball outfit. If only he knew who that was... Let\u2019s see what some celebrity Tweeters think! Mr Johnny Vegas, over to you ... wait, what do you mean you hate it?! Eight minutes in and Maura\u2019s just said her catchphrase. And the official #fannyfluttersvajazzle is in a Primark near you in 5, 4, 3... The Islanders are off to a summer ball. If only there was a dancer in the villa. The Flack\u2019s just reminded us that 36 islanders have been through the villa this year. Do you even know 36 people?! I\u2019m not sure I do. Feels like a great time for an #isleneverforgetyou part III and justice for Sherif Lanre, who was booted out of the villa for accidentally booting Molly-Mae, and then never spoken of again. He\u2019s been the subject of a death hoax, though we\u2019ve not been able to confirm whether he started it himself. The Flack is back! Look at her go! Below the line, Marylynn says she\u2019s rooting for \u2018Murtis\u2019, comparing them to \u201ca 70s sitcom couple\u201d. Marylynn, while I admire your love of Murtis and that beautiful description, didn\u2019t you see how Maura\u2019s mum was looking at him last night? She did NOT approve, and was far more interested in Ovie (though, really, who isn\u2019t?!) Time for #isleneverforgetyou part 2: remember when Tom decided to find out if Maura was \u201call mouth\u201d? Feels like a while ago, doesn\u2019t it? And if you want to feel REALLY old, this is what Tom looks like now: Below the line, benzedrine has commented that \u201cMolly Mae... owns a toy elephant? That is literally all I know about her after seven weeks of whatever\u201d. To which I say, please have some respect - the elephant has a name (Ellie Belly)! Conspiracy theory alert! @bethseager_ on Twitter has suggested that the couple to the right of Caroline Flack will be the winners, based on the past four series. Has she cracked the code?

      "bodyText": "The increased migration of \u201clow-skill\u201d workers could contribute to poor pay growth at the lower end of the labour market, according to a Grattan Institute report. The paper, presented by chief executive John Daley at the Reserve Bank conference on Monday, argues for an increase in penalties and enforcement to prevent \u201crational\u201d exploitation and underpayment of migrant workers. It comes as the Morrison government has committed to criminalise worker exploitation in a bid to blunt Labor\u2019s criticisms that the Coalition is pursuing legislation to increase penalties for union breaches of industrial law but failing to combat systemic underpayment. The Grattan paper noted that current expert opinion is that \u201cin general migration does not lead to slower wages growth\u201d but suggested low-skill workers could suppress wages at the 20% of the labour market paid at or around the minimum wage. It said while the full scale of underpayment is hard to estimate, the Fair Work Ombudsman had found 60% of 7-Eleven stores underpaid their staff and an audit of the harvest trail found serious underpayment at 130 of 836 businesses. Contrary to perceptions of a high-skilled migration program, the paper noted that low-skilled migrants make up an increasing proportion of temporary visa holders. Of 1 million temporary migrants, 450,000 have student visas, and 150,000 have working holiday visas. \u201cOf those temporary visa holders who do work, most (59%) are in low-skill occupations. Of those with student and working holiday visas who work, even more (about 75%) are in low-skill occupations, primarily labourers and personal and community service.\u201d The paper argued that migrants have \u201cstrong incentives to work because they generally don\u2019t qualify for welfare payments\u201d. It suggested that migrant workers would be unlikely to complain about underpayment if they are in breach of visa conditions because they are working more hours than permitted. \u201cFor people entitled to work, $14 an hour is better than no work at all, and they may well prefer not to imperil their employment.\u201d The paper noted that measured wages of people aged 20 to 34 \u201chave not risen as fast as the wages of older workers for some time\u201d. \u201cIt is possible that the scale of this influx to the labour market is depressing wages and increasing under-employment specifically for low-skill younger workers,\u201d it concluded. However, the report said increased low-skilled migration \u201ccan\u2019t possibly explain more than a portion of the low wage growth story\u201d and does not explain stagnation at the middle and top of the income distribution. The paper recommended that \u201cthere should probably be more enforcement\u201d and current penalties for underpayment \u201care clearly far too low\u201d. \u201cAt the moment, the major risk for an underpaying employer is that they might have to pay a portion of the wages that they should have paid in the first place. In terms of pure incentives, it is rational for many employers to underpay.\u201d The paper also called for a rethink on visa conditions which \u201ceffectively give employers enormous bargaining power, and facilitate underpayment of wages\u201d. These include the limit on international visitors working no more than 20 hours per week and the requirement for working holiday makers to work in agriculture or specified regions. On Wednesday Scott Morrison said the attorney general, Christian Porter, is \u201cright now \u2026 drafting laws to deal with criminalising worker exploitation\u201d. Before the election the Coalition accepted recommendations from the migrant worker taskforce to introduce criminal penalties for systemic and deliberate underpayments. The Coalition has reduced Australia\u2019s permanent migration cap from 190,000 a year to 160,000. Before the election, Labor promised to instead crack down on underqualified temporary visa holders. On Monday a One Nation motion in the Senate to establish a plebiscite on Australia\u2019s migration rate was defeated 54 votes to two, with only party leader Pauline Hanson and senator Malcolm Roberts voting in favour.",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal backbencher Eric Abetz says the \u201cburden\u201d of government debt prevents the Coalition increasing the Newstart allowance. Asked about the Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce\u2019s decision to break ranks and call for a boost to the dole, Abetz told the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday night he thought \u201cevery politician [would] love to increase Newstart\u201d. But Abetz said past years of \u201cdeficit budgeting\u201d meant Australia could not afford an increase to Newstart, which currently stands at $277.85 a week for a single person without children. \u201cAnd if we didn\u2019t have that burden of debt, didn\u2019t have to pay that interest, chances are there would be money around to, in fact, provide an increase for Newstart,\u201d he said. Last month, the Coalition passed its income tax cut package, which cost $158bn over a decade and will eventually slash marginal rates for high-income earners. The budget forecast a $7.1bn surplus in 2019-20. The $75 increase to Newstart advocated by the Australian Council of Social Service would cost about $3bn annually, although Deloitte modelling has estimated the resulting stimulus would create an extra $1bn in taxes. Joyce drew criticism on Monday for initially saying he had newfound empathy for the unemployed because he was now struggling to make ends meet on a backbencher\u2019s salary of more than $200,000. The former World Vision boss Tim Costello praised the former deputy prime minister for advocating an increase. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s immoral,\u201d Costello said of the Newstart rate. Abetz entered parliament in 1994, the year the unemployment payment was last raised in real terms. Since then, the base salary of a federal politician has increased from $68,000 to $210,000 a year. He acknowledged Newstart was \u201cdifficult to live on\u201d but claimed \u201cin fairness it is indexed each year but from a very low base\u201d. \u201cIt has been increased in line with inflation over the years that it has been operating,\u201d he said. The Howard government\u2019s decision to benchmark Newstart to inflation effectively froze the payment at 1994 levels. If Newstart was instead tied to wages, like the pension, recipients would get a base rate of $351.91 a week. The Labor senator Kimberley Kitching said she believed an increase to the payment was now inevitable. \u201cI\u2019m not going to denigrate Barnaby Joyce for arriving at a position of empathy, no matter the path he trod to get there,\u201d she said. Abetz also backed the government\u2019s plans to criminalise wage theft. This month, the MasterChef host George Calombaris was in the middle of a $7.8m underpayment scandal. The chef Adam Liaw, a former MasterChef constant, said \u201cputting people in prison for doing large scale systemic wage theft is certainly something that definitely should be on the table\u201d. But Liaw also said the awards system needed to be simplified to help smaller businesses \u201cwho don\u2019t have large payroll facilities and large payroll operations\u201d. \u201cThe carrot and the stick will have an effect here and it will be the way we need to go,\u201d he said. Abetz was also questioned by disability support pensioner Duncan Storrar about Scott Morrison\u2019s promise to address suicide. In 2016, Storrar\u2019s personal circumstances were dredged up by News Corp papers after he appeared on Q&amp;A and criticised the Coalition\u2019s policies towards the poor. \u201cWould raising Newstart and reducing punitive social security obligations be the fastest way to make a dint in the rate of suicide and domestic violence amongst the country\u2019s three million poor people?\u201d Storrar asked on Monday.",

In the meantime, please, for the sake of the party and especially for the sake of the country, think beyond the messenger, and think seriously about the message.\u201d Labour had no comment on Campbell\u2019s letter. It comes after Peter Mandelson, another former Labour strategist under Blair, gave an interview over the weekend calling for a new party leader, although he said he would not leave the party. \u201cWe are now in a situation where many people will react with horror against what Johnson plans to do \u2013 defying parliament to take Britain out of the EU without a deal to safeguard our trade and jobs \u2013 but have no faith in Corbyn\u2019s desire or ability to block this,\u201d Mandelson told Alain Elkann for La Stampa and other European newspapers. \u201cCorbyn is not the leader that Labour needs at this time. He cannot deliver. Even his supporters are realising this. We need an alternative who can stand up to Johnson and lead the country against the disaster which is in the making.\u201d",

The EFL had given Dale a deadline of 5pm on Monday to show \u201cproof of funds\u201d after he missed a previous deadline of last Thursday, which was accompanied by a threat of possible expulsion from the league . Bolton Wanderers, who are in administration after a financial collapse under the owner, Ken Anderson, were also issued with a 5pm deadline to resolve how around \u00a32m owed to former players will be paid by a consortium, Football Ventures, which is nearing completion of a takeover. Ultimately the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association is understood to have agreed a loan to cover the outstanding wages for the consortium, which is paying unsecured creditors 35p for each \u00a31 owed. The EFL, in its statement, declared itself satisfied with the information provided and cleared Bolton \u2013 \u201csubject to the completion of formal documentation\u201d \u2013 to start its League One season, on Saturday away at Wycombe Wanderers. Both Bury and Bolton, near neighbours and rivals, face initial deductions of 12 points for entering insolvency proceedings \u2013 Dale succeeded in having a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) passed by sufficient unsecured creditors earlier this month to enable him to pay them 25p in the pound. However, having failed to provide \u201cproof of funds\u201d to the EFL before or shortly after his \u00a31 takeover in December as required by the league\u2019s rules, eight months later he has still not shown that he can fund approximately \u00a31m to be paid under the CVA and a further \u00a31m owed to \u201cfootball creditors\u201d \u2013 players, former managers, other clubs and agents \u2013 who must be paid in full. The EFL regulations require clubs to show how they will be funded to ensure they complete a season\u2019s fixtures and Dale has not provided that evidence either for Bury, who are under a player registration embargo. At 10pm on Friday the EFL board agreed to extend Bury\u2019s deadline to 12pm on Monday then during the day, allowed it to run further, until 5pm. However, in a statement issued at 9:43pm, the EFL board signalled that Dale had still not provided satisfactory information, its patience had run out and Bury would be prevented from starting the season. \u201cFollowing continued and comprehensive discussions with the ownership at Bury and other interested parties throughout Monday the EFL Board is not satisfied it has received the necessary evidence in regard to the outstanding information it requires that demonstrates how the Club will be funded moving forwards,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs a result of not meeting Monday\u2019s 5pm deadline, which had been extended on two previous occasions, the EFL Board feels it has been placed in an unenviable position and, regrettably, has opted to take the reluctant decision to suspend Saturday\u2019s opening day fixture with MK Dons under the provision of EFL Regulation 28.2. \u201cIn addition the EFL Board, if not in possession of the necessary evidence by 12pm on Friday 2 August 2019, will make a determination as to whether to suspend Bury\u2019s away fixture at Accrington Stanley on Saturday 10 August 2019. \u201cAs has been the case throughout this entire process, the EFL will continue to offer its full assistance to the ownership at Bury, but remains clear that while the League is here to support the Club through some extremely complex and complicated issues, the outstanding matters can be resolved only with the cooperation from the Club itself.\u201d Dale bought Bury for \u00a31 in December from the previous owner, Stewart Day, who had taken out loans secured on the Gigg Lane ground, strengthened the squad and run the club at a loss, but whose property businesses were on the brink of financial collapse. However Dale, whose business has involved selling the assets of companies falling into insolvency, never provided the EFL with proof that he had the necessary money and in May the players who won promotion revealed that they had not been paid since February.",

It leaves the uncapped Jofra Archer as the final fitness query. The fast bowler is to be assessed at Edgbaston on Tuesday following the side strain he battled through during England\u2019s victorious World Cup campaign. Archer played a T20 Blast match for Sussex last Friday but his ability to get through 20 overs in a day of Test cricket so soon will dictate whether he is handed a Test debut at Edgbaston or held back until the second Test at Lord\u2019s which starts on 14 August. In contrast to the top order there is at least healthy competition for seam bowling places. Chris Woakes, though in the middle of a heavy summer workload, returned a career-best six for 17 against Ireland and knows Edgbaston better than anyone. Broad also took seven wickets across two innings in that match and Olly Stone\u2019s pace impressed on debut, while Sam Curran has the ability to swing the ball from a left-arm angle and offer additional batting depth down the order. A further change brings Ben Stokes back as the vice-captain \u2013 the position he held in 2017 before the infamous Bristol incident at the end of the summer saw him removed from the role and stood down from that winter\u2019s Ashes series. Speaking on a visit to his former club, Cockermouth CC in Cumbria, the 28-year-old said: \u201cI love having that responsibility and it is something I thoroughly enjoy doing.

I entered parliament to do precisely this,\u201d Mercer said.</p> <p>In March, it was announced that one paratrooper, known only as Soldier F, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/14/one-soldier-to-face-charges-over-bloody-sunday-killings\">would be prosecuted for murder and attempted murder</a> following the deaths of 13 civil rights demonstrators on Bloody Sunday in 1972. Families representing victims said they were disappointed that more former soldiers had not been prosecuted.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/25/up-to-200-ex-soldiers-being-investigated-over-troubles-allegations\">A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/25/up-to-200-ex-soldiers-being-investigated-over-troubles-allegations\">bout 150 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/25/up-to-200-ex-soldiers-being-investigated-over-troubles-allegations\">to 200 army veterans and police officers</a> are believed to be under investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Military cases account for about 30% of the workload, but only cover 10% of the deaths from that period.</p> <p>Mercer will run the Office for Veterans\u2019 Affairs with Oliver Dowden, the paymaster general, who will act as a minister representing veterans in the cabinet. The office will work across government but will be based in the Cabinet Office and staffed partly by officials from the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>Molloy added that the appointment of Mercer was \u201canother calculated insult to victims of British state violence\u201d and that any attempt to create a hierarchy \u201cby protecting perpetrators of murders and other serious crime committed by British state forces are totally unacceptable\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Johnny Mercer\u2019s appointment as minister for veterans has prompted Sinn F\u00e9in to voice concern that a Boris Johnson-led government would extend a proposed amnesty from prosecution for ex-soldiers to cover those who served in Northern Ireland. Initial briefings suggested the new prime minister had told Mercer \u2013 who has campaigned for the amnesty to be extended to cover the Troubles \u2013 in a phone call to halt vexatious claims made against all former soldiers. That led Francie Molloy, an MP for the Irish nationalist party, to declare Mercer\u2019s elevation to be \u201cfurther evidence\u201d that the government intended to give \u201ccurrent and former British soldiers immunity from prosecution\u201d. There has been growing pressure in Conservative circles to halt historic prosecutions of military personnel following the collapse of the Iraq historic allegations team (Ihat) following allegations that claims had been dishonestly been brought forward. Last week, the then defence secretary Penny Mordaunt unveiled a consultation aimed at introducing a presumption against prosecution for alleged offences committed in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere outside the UK more than 10 years ago. But it was careful to exclude Northern Ireland, which is part of a separate process to examine how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles, in which 3,500 people died over a three-decade period and many cases remain legally unresolved. Mercer, a former army officer, had announced he was withholding support from Theresa May\u2019s government until an end was brought to what he described as the \u201cabhorrent process\u201d of \u201celderly veterans being dragged back to Northern Ireland\u201d. The official announcement of Mercer\u2019s appointment on Monday as minister for defence people and veterans was accompanied by plans to create an Office for Veterans\u2019 Affairs \u201cto deliver the lifelong support our veterans deserve\u201d. It contained no direct reference to plans for an amnesty, but Whitehall sources acknowledged that Mercer was privately briefing he had been told by Johnson that he would be able to examine the historic prosecutions issue. \u201cI am delighted with this role and am resolutely determined to reset this country\u2019s relationship with her veterans. I entered parliament to do precisely this,\u201d Mercer said. In March, it was announced that one paratrooper, known only as Soldier F, would be prosecuted for murder and attempted murder following the deaths of 13 civil rights demonstrators on Bloody Sunday in 1972. Families representing victims said they were disappointed that more former soldiers had not been prosecuted. About 150 to 200 army veterans and police officers are believed to be under investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Military cases account for about 30% of the workload, but only cover 10% of the deaths from that period. Mercer will run the Office for Veterans\u2019 Affairs with Oliver Dowden, the paymaster general, who will act as a minister representing veterans in the cabinet. The office will work across government but will be based in the Cabinet Office and staffed partly by officials from the Ministry of Defence. Molloy added that the appointment of Mercer was \u201canother calculated insult to victims of British state violence\u201d and that any attempt to create a hierarchy \u201cby protecting perpetrators of murders and other serious crime committed by British state forces are totally unacceptable\u201d.",

And what comes after him will be far, far worse.\u201d The DNI does not run the intelligence agencies directly, but coordinates their work and determines budgets and priorities. The director also briefs the president and Congress on the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of global threats. It is unclear if Ratcliffe will be able to secure Senate confirmation. His inexperience and partisanship would come under intense scrutiny, but the Republican majority has generally been disciplined in following Trump\u2019s wishes. Senior Republicans who responded to Trump\u2019s announcement, praised Coats but did not mention Ratcliffe. The nomination may also falter on the law establishing the DNI position, which states any nominee \u201cshall have extensive national security expertise\u201d. If Ratcliffe is confirmed and sought to politicise intelligence work further, it could lead to a clash with the intelligence agency professionals, warned John Sipher, a veteran of the CIA\u2019s national clandestine services. \u201cIf he tries to spin intelligence in a different way that it is presented to him, his work force would rebel,\u201d Sipher said, predicting there would be a spike in resignations and leaks. \u201cHe is going to get a lot of knives stuck in his back.\u201d",

The prime minister himself insisted there was an \u201cassumption that we can get a new deal\u201d and that he wanted to reach out to European leaders.</p> <p>However, his deputy official spokeswoman reinforced the position of Michael Gove, the cabinet lead for no-deal preparations, that \u201cwe must assume that there will be a no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> on 31 October\u201d unless EU leaders agree to reopen talks on the withdrawal agreement. The spokeswoman also made clear Johnson would not be meeting EU leaders until they agree to make a new deal that does not involve the Irish backstop.</p> <p>As the pound lurched downwards on Monday, an array of leading business groups lined up to voice exasperation that a lack of information from the government was hampering preparations for no deal.</p> <p>Echoing a warning from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/cbi\">Confederation of British Industry</a> at the weekend Britain is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/big-business-show-some-spine-no-deal-brexit-cbi\">ill-equipped</a> for a disorderly EU departure, lobby groups representing firms employing millions of people across the UK sounded the alarm.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the lack of preparedness among its members was \u201cfrightening\u201d, while the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said industry\u2019s questions about how to prepare had \u201cgone unanswered\u201d. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said guidance from government had been partial and was yet to be properly road tested.</p> <p>The pound fell by more than 1.3% against the US currency to trade at about $1.2216, its lowest point since March 2017, extending a slide under way over recent months as the chance of the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of October mounts.

      "bodyText": "The pound has slumped to a 28-month low as investors reacted with alarm to the escalation of no-deal rhetoric by Boris Johnson\u2019s government. Sterling dropped below $1.23 against the US dollar and fell sharply against the euro to below \u20ac1.10 on the international currency markets on Monday, as cabinet ministers began meetings to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. But while the pound suffered, there was confusion from Johnson\u2019s government about whether a no-deal Brexit is the main working assumption. The prime minister himself insisted there was an \u201cassumption that we can get a new deal\u201d and that he wanted to reach out to European leaders. However, his deputy official spokeswoman reinforced the position of Michael Gove, the cabinet lead for no-deal preparations, that \u201cwe must assume that there will be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October\u201d unless EU leaders agree to reopen talks on the withdrawal agreement. The spokeswoman also made clear Johnson would not be meeting EU leaders until they agree to make a new deal that does not involve the Irish backstop. As the pound lurched downwards on Monday, an array of leading business groups lined up to voice exasperation that a lack of information from the government was hampering preparations for no deal. Echoing a warning from the Confederation of British Industry at the weekend Britain is ill-equipped for a disorderly EU departure, lobby groups representing firms employing millions of people across the UK sounded the alarm. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the lack of preparedness among its members was \u201cfrightening\u201d, while the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said industry\u2019s questions about how to prepare had \u201cgone unanswered\u201d. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said guidance from government had been partial and was yet to be properly road tested. The pound fell by more than 1.3% against the US currency to trade at about $1.2216, its lowest point since March 2017, extending a slide under way over recent months as the chance of the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of October mounts. The pound was down by a similar amount against the single currency at \u20ac1.0965. Analysts said comments from senior figures in Johnson\u2019s cabinet had rocked the City, including a suggestion from Dominic Raab on Monday morning that the UK would be in a better place to negotiate a good deal with the EU after no-deal Brexit. The foreign secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the EU\u2019s \u201cstubborn\u201d behaviour would be responsible if the UK left without an agreement with Brussels at the end of October. Petr Krpata of the City bank ING said: \u201cThe market [is] awaking to the reality of a new UK government, its rather combative stance on the current EU-UK Brexit deal, and its open remarks on the rising probability of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at financial trading platform IG, said: \u201cWith two months until the October deadline, there is reason to believe that the pound has plenty more downside to come.\u201d Over the weekend, several key figures in Johnson\u2019s government said the prime minister was \u201cturbo-charging\u201d preparations for no deal. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is expected to ramp up spending on no-deal readiness by about \u00a31bn this week and the government is preparing to spend around \u00a3100m on a public information campaign for citizens and businesses using broadcast media and billboards. Hitting holidaymakers in the pocket as they head abroad during the school holidays, the pound has sunk by more than 10 cents against the dollar from a peak in excess of $1.33 in March. Against the euro it has fallen by more than 7 cents from a high of \u20ac1.17 recorded in May. The BCC, which represents 75,000 businesses employing 6 million people, called on the government to up the ante on no-deal preparations. \u201cThe 31 October deadline is fast approaching and businesses are being told to prepare for no deal, but there are still significant areas where there is simply little basis on which to plan,\u201d said Claire Walker, co-executive director of the BCC. \u201cBusiness communities want the government to make every effort to avoid no deal, but at the same time, urgently need it to up the ante on its planning to enable firms to prepare for all scenarios.\u201d The FSB urged the government to \u201cput its money where its mouth is\u201d by handing \u00a33,000 \u201cBrexit vouchers\u201d to small firms that trade overseas, to help them pay for advice on navigating custom and tariffs. Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the IoD, also called for firms to be issued with Brexit vouchers and criticised the lack of detail from government. \u201cWe have long urged our members to make any preparations they can for no deal, but many smaller firms simply haven\u2019t had the time or money to spend on getting ready for something that has not been, and still isn\u2019t, government policy,\u201d he said. Make UK, the trade body for manufacturers, said many firms had already spent money preparing for the original Brexit date in March and might struggle to raise more cash. \u201cWarehousing costs have increased enormously and October is a time when capacity is already pre-booked by retailers for Christmas,\u201d said Ben Fletcher, executive director of communications, government and policy. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more expensive for businesses that struggled to prepare in the spring.\u201d",

RIP Trevor.\u201d 19-year-old gunman identified Police identified the shooter as 19-year-old Santino William Legan. Several news organizations, including Reuters, reported that prior to the shooting Legan had apparently posted a photo from the garlic festival on his Instagram account. \u201cAyyy garlic festival time,\u201d he wrote in the caption. \u201cCome get wasted on overpriced shit.\u201d Another post referenced a racist, sexist essay. A second suspect was \u201cinvolved in some way, we just don\u2019t know in what way\u201d, the Gilroy police chief, Scot Smithee, said at a late-night news conference on Sunday. On Monday, Smithee said that police were \u201cno closer to determining whether there was or was not a second suspect and, if there was, what involvement they may have\u201d. California has some of the most stringent gun laws in the country, banning most assault weapons and .50-caliber rifles, as well as the sale, transfer, manufacture and possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines. But on Monday afternoon at a press conference, police chief Smithee said Legan had bought the rifle legally in the neighboring state of Nevada on 9 July. Big Mikes Gun and Ammo, the store in Nevada where the gunman reportedly purchased his weapon, posted a statement on Facebook condemning the attack and offering condolences to the victims. It also said the shooter had purchased the weapon from the store\u2019s website. Neighbors described the Legan family as a married couple who had raised the shooter and his brother in the house being searched, and said they were \u201cvery nice people\u201d and \u201cvery devoted parents\u201d who had moved to the block nearly 20 years ago. Elia Scettrini, 65, said she had seen Tom, the father, spending time and playing with his sons, including training with them in their boxing gym they had set up in the garage. \u201cUsually kids are alone. These kids were not alone,\u201d she said. Before his retirement, Larry Scettrini, who had worked as a licensed therapist in the local juvenile justice system, said he had seen no signs that either of the boys were troubled. He said: \u201cNot even a whisper about arms or politics, or any of the issues that would be normally discussed if you had an anger issue or a problem with society.\u201d He went on: \u201cGilroy is very conservative on gun rights issues. Gun rights people say if you have more guns, there\u2019ll be less violence. There were plenty of police present at the festival, and that didn\u2019t prevent the violence.\u201d Smithee said on Monday that it was too early in the investigation to determine if any of the victims were targeted, or if the shooter fired indiscriminately. Founded in 1979, the Gilroy garlic festival revolves around the region\u2019s celebrated crop, and features garlic-inspired foods, drink, live entertainment and cooking competitions. It is hosted by volunteers and describes itself as the world\u2019s greatest summer food festival. A few hours before the shooting, festivalgoers were still showing up by the busload, milling around Christmas Hill Park under a hot sun and amid the scent of garlic. Parents fed their toddlers bites of garlic ice cream as families lounged under the shade of the trees, fanning themselves in the heat. Women danced to live music while others munched on garlic fries, garlic pasta, garlic bread and garlic shrimp. Videos posted on social media appeared to show attendees scattering in confusion as at least one loud popping sound could be heard in the background. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d a woman can be heard asking on one video. \u201cWho\u2019d shoot up a garlic festival?\u201d Politicians respond Donald Trump responded on Sunday night with a tweet advising people in the area to \u201cbe careful and safe\u201d. The US president was initially silent about the shooting on Monday, instead resuming his Twitter attacks, begun over the weekend, against the senior Democratic congressman Elijah Cummings. He had called Cummings\u2019 home city of Baltimore \u201crat-infested\u201d, in an affront critics said was bigoted and racist. Later on Monday morning, at the White House, Trump said: \u201cWe express our deepest sadness and sorrow for the families who lost precious loved ones.\u201d He called the shooting horrific and the gunman a \u201cwicked murderer\u201d. Political reactions, including calls for gun reform, followed swiftly in the wake of the attack. \u201cMy heart breaks for all of our Bay Area neighbors who attended the Gilroy garlic festival,\u201d tweeted the California congressman Eric Swalwell, who campaigned briefly for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination and was the only one of two dozen candidates to focus his platform primarily on stronger gun control. \u201cWe need gun reform and we need it now,\u201d he said. The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ranks California first in the nation for its laws. It was unclear on Monday where or how the suspect acquired the assault-style rifle used in the attack. Senator Kamala Harris, who represents California and is running for president, tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m grateful to the first responders who are on the scene in Gilroy, and my thoughts are with that community tonight. Our country has a gun violence epidemic that we cannot tolerate.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, tweeted: \u201cOur thoughts are with the families of those lost last night in Gilroy, CA, as well as the survivors facing a tough road ahead. \u201cBut thoughts are not enough \u2013 action must be taken to end gun violence. Every day the Senate refuses to act is a stain on the conscience of our nation.\u201d Another US lawmaker, congressman Dan Lipinski of Illinois, was at the festival with his wife when the shooting took place. \u201cThe shooter was not far from us when we heard the loud \u2018pops\u2019, which seemed to get closer as we ran,\u201d he said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThe level of gun violence in our nation is sickening. It is an issue we must deal with not only legislatively, but spiritually and socially.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Michael O\u2019Leary has said he cannot rule out making some of Ryanair\u2019s 17,500 staff redundant if the Boeing 737 Max stays grounded for longer than expected while investigations continue into two fatal crashes involving the aircraft. Speaking as the low-cost airline\u2019s first-quarter profits slumped by 24%, the carrier\u2019s chief executive bemoaned the impact of delays in the return to service of the 737 Max, a key component of Ryanair\u2019s strategy to arrest the decline in its financial performance. Ryanair has 135 of the 737 Max models on order, with 58 due for delivery by summer 2020, but the airline will not accept them until regulators have declared the plane safe to fly. O\u2019Leary warned that Ryanair may not have any of the planes ready by next summer unless Boeing \u201cgets their shit together\u201d in making upgrades required by regulators. The grounding of the global fleet of 737 Max aircraft has already taken its toll on Ryanair, forcing the airline to halve growth targets for next year as it scrapped 30,000 planned flights and warned it could close bases at airports. \u201cWe would not rule out redundancies and job losses, which will be inevitable if these Max delays are as presently envisaged or get worse,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. At least one Boeing 737 Max that was due to be delivered to Ryanair has had the name Max dropped from the livery, fuelling speculation that the manufacturer and airlines will seek to rebrand the troubled plane. The airline\u2019s 24% drop in quarterly profits was compounded by price wars in several European markets. It said average fares at Europe\u2019s largest low-cost carrier were likely to fall by 6% over the crucial summer period compared with last year, as airlines cut prices to stimulate demand, particularly in Germany and the UK. O\u2019Leary pointed to competition driving down prices in Germany, as well as reduced spending in the UK as Brexit uncertainty hits consumer confidence. \u201cWe are cautious on pricing into the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cBrexit and the risk of a hard Brexit has materially increased with the new government in the UK.\u201d The decline in fares pushed pretax profit down to \u20ac262m (\u00a3236m) for the three months to 30 June, compared with \u20ac345m in the same period of 2018. But the company stuck to its annual profit target of between \u20ac750m and \u20ac950m as passengers continued to spend on onboard extras, which include food, perfume and scratchcards. Shares in the airline fell by 0.7% by the end of the day, having almost halved in value in two years as it grapples with overcapacity, repeated strikes by disgruntled pilots and cabin crew, Brexit uncertainty and the 737 delays. O\u2019Leary lashed out at unions for threatening new strikes, with action planned by pilots in the UK and Ireland, as well as cabin crew in Portugal. \u201cIt seems to us that even by the standards of some of these trade unions, this is chronically ill-timed and ill-judged,\u201d he said, adding that it could coincide with the period in which the company would be announcing cuts related to the Max grounding.",

Dominic Raab\u2019s first outing as foreign secretary on Monday\u2019s Today programme gave an unsavoury flavour of what to expect: he suggested Vote Leave always said no deal was on the cards \u2013 but it never did. As is his wont, Raab turned nasty when rightly challenged by presenter Mishal Husain.

With four parties in play, Johnson is not yet the proven winner he promised his party \u2013 and has no hope of \u201cuniting the country\u201d. As he tours the land with a bag full of spending promises, he will need to make them good soon \u2013 but no deal will leave him with thin Treasury receipts and heavy compensations to pay for all the losers, before any new spending.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/boris-johnson-says-hell-spend-but-who-will-pay\">Boris Johnson says he\u2019ll spend, but who will pay?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Better to run for an election before his promises turn to dust. Best to go before 31 October, the disaster date when either he compromises, the European Research Group explodes and Nigel Farage eats a fat slice of his vote, or he crashes out of the EU when the chance of winning an election amid no-deal mayhem bodes even worse. Either way, the Johnson regime will not last long: the only question is whether he brings down the country as he goes, leaving us ruinously Brexited with no deal.</p> \n<p>His one hope is the feeble opposition, letting Jo Swinson sweep up remainers appalled at Labour\u2019s pitiful response to Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan. A quick election means catching Corbyn still in post, the lowest polling opposition leader in history: polls show Labour\u2019s vote jumps up without Corbyn. There is no predicting the outcome, but there is great strength in the anti-no-deal plotters in the Commons, with Keir Starmer gathering with the immensely powerful Tory backbench rebels ready to prevent no deal. The serried ranks of grandees, from Oliver Letwin and Philip Hammond, to Rory Stewart and Dominic Grieve, will be formidable opposition to Johnson. Either they will bring him down, or Johnson will call an election himself to avoid that fate.</p> \n<p>In that rebellious atmosphere, and despite the handicap of Corbyn, an election foolishly fought on a no-deal Brexit platform would be winnable by the considerable combined forces of reason. No deal is a losing cause that not even Cummings\u2019s dark arts can turn into a winner. Bring it on and Johnson stands a high risk of being seen off before his 100 days are up.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 July 2019 to clarify a reference to Margaret Thatcher and the EU.</p>",

As he tours the land with a bag full of spending promises, he will need to make them good soon \u2013 but no deal will leave him with thin Treasury receipts and heavy compensations to pay for all the losers, before any new spending. Better to run for an election before his promises turn to dust. Best to go before 31 October, the disaster date when either he compromises, the European Research Group explodes and Nigel Farage eats a fat slice of his vote, or he crashes out of the EU when the chance of winning an election amid no-deal mayhem bodes even worse. Either way, the Johnson regime will not last long: the only question is whether he brings down the country as he goes, leaving us ruinously Brexited with no deal. His one hope is the feeble opposition, letting Jo Swinson sweep up remainers appalled at Labour\u2019s pitiful response to Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan. A quick election means catching Corbyn still in post, the lowest polling opposition leader in history: polls show Labour\u2019s vote jumps up without Corbyn. There is no predicting the outcome, but there is great strength in the anti-no-deal plotters in the Commons, with Keir Starmer gathering with the immensely powerful Tory backbench rebels ready to prevent no deal. The serried ranks of grandees, from Oliver Letwin and Philip Hammond, to Rory Stewart and Dominic Grieve, will be formidable opposition to Johnson. Either they will bring him down, or Johnson will call an election himself to avoid that fate. In that rebellious atmosphere, and despite the handicap of Corbyn, an election foolishly fought on a no-deal Brexit platform would be winnable by the considerable combined forces of reason. No deal is a losing cause that not even Cummings\u2019s dark arts can turn into a winner. Bring it on and Johnson stands a high risk of being seen off before his 100 days are up. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 30 July 2019 to clarify a reference to Margaret Thatcher and the EU.",

When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A spokesperson for Woodford said: \u201cNeil remains invested in WPCT and completely committed to the early-stage asset class and its long-term investment potential.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woodford Patient Capital Trust has an independent board whose job is to act in the interests of shareholders.

The memo showed the department believed that the $3,152 fine \u2013 a 20th of the maximum fine for a single infringement \u2013 would serve as a deterrent. The company\u2019s parent New Hope Group made $160m in after-tax profit in the six months to January 2019. Details of the investigation\u2019s findings and the fine were never made public \u2013 by the state or the miner \u2013 and have been uncovered in a tranche of documents obtained by the environmental group Lock the Gate. A Lock the Gate Queensland spokeswoman, Ellie Smith, said: \u201cThis latest paltry fine, kept secret by the department, will do nothing to stop New Hope\u2019s irresponsible behaviour.\u201d New Acland was fined for breaching noise limits at the mine and remains under investigation in relation to allegations it mined outside its approvals. The documents detail how New Hope Group had increased production at the mine to meet supply contracts, and that as a result blasting and loading operations were being conducted with 200 metres of adjacent landholders. New Hope is seeking final approvals for its \u201cstage three\u201d expansion of New Acland, a project that has been in administrative and legal limbo for more than a decade. The expansion has fiercely divided locals on the Darling Downs, and is opposed by many landholders. In 2017 the Queensland land court appeared to scupper the expansion by ruling that groundwater issues were \u201cinsurmountable\u201d, but that decision was overturned last year after judicial review. An appeal remains before the courts. The miner has added to the urgency to the process, and sought to pressure the Queensland government, by saying it would have to start sacking workers in September if it did not gain outstanding approvals. During state estimates hearings last week, the Queensland mines minister, Anthony Lynham, said a decision on a water licence would be made by the end of September, but he gave no timeline for the final approval of a mining lease. Lock the Gate argues that should not be granted until all legal processes are completed. The $3,152 fine for illegal drilling related to exploratory bores within the boundaries of the company\u2019s operational mining leases, but outside the area designated for mining activity in the mine\u2019s plan of operations. The documents show New Acland argued that its plan of operations noted that exploration drilling would occur, and that it was \u201coverly restrictive and pedantic\u201d to be required to identify precise locations. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The department\u2019s decision memo said the breach of the Environmental Protection Act was \u201cindisputable\u201d. Smith said the miner\u2019s activities were having a detrimental impact on farmers and local residents. \u201cThe people of Oakey and Jondaryan are fed up, and are worried that is the New Acland stage three expansion goes ahead, local businesses will go into terminal decline.\u201d A farmer from nearby Mount Darry, Desley Spies, said: \u201cNew Hope is treating the farmers of our region very poorly, despite the fact we produce food and fibre here on the Darling Downs which Queensland relies on. \u201cThe farming land around Oakey is classed in the top 1.5% in Queensland. It is madness that it should be destroyed for the sake of a temporary coalmine.\u201d New Hope has been contacted for comment.",

      "bodyText": "The latest report of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, released on Tuesday by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, confirms that Australia\u2019s living standards are falling and that median household incomes have not grown since 2009. The annual Hilda survey is one of the most important economic studies done in this country. Unlike the figures for household incomes done by the bureau of statistics the Hilda survey is a longitudinal study which interviews the same households each year. This provides intriguing data on the changes within households as well as across the nation. It also allows us to track the movements of people across occupations, locations, income levels and other socio-economic indicators. It is essentially a 7 Up series but done on a much larger scale and using data rather than documentary. The latest survey reveals that the median household income in 2017 was $80,095 \u2013 a fall of 0.6% from 2016: And while a one-year slump in incomes is cause for concern, the reality is that this is a very long-term issue as the Hilda survey reveals there has been no increase in median household incomes since 2009. If we compare Australian and US median household incomes since 2001, it is clear that Australian households benefited greatly from the mining boom, while the US was mostly trapped in a period of stagnation before being hit by the GFC. But since 2014, while Australian median incomes have been flat, the US has seen solid growth: What the survey also reveals is that since 2009, while the median household income has remained flat, the mean (or average) income has risen 3.4% (still a pathetic amount): This divergence happens when the income of richer households grows faster than the median ones. In 2009, the income of households in the 90th percentile was 1.82 times that of the median household \u2013 now it is 1.91 times. This is not a massive increase and is roughly the ratio that was in place in 2001, but it has meant there has been an increase in inequality since 2009. The Hilda survey calculates the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality on a scale of 0 to 1 (a higher value meaning more inequality), two ways \u2013 an annual level and a long-term measure, which looks at income over a five-year period. Both measures saw an increase in 2017, but while annual inequality in 2017 is roughly around the level it has been for most of this century, the long-term inequality has risen for most of this century: One aspect of long-term inequality is the intergenerational movement of people across income levels. The more equal a society is the more easy it is for someone who was raised in a lower income household to be in a higher income level as an adult. The Hilda survey found that 38% of those who in 2001 were a child in household in the poorest 20% were in that same bottom quintile when an adult in 2017. Conversely, 31% of those who were in the top income quintile as a child were also in that quintile as an adult: As the authors note, there are \u201cclear indications of a positive correlation between parental income and the income of children in later life\u201d. Interestingly they found that mothers and daughters were more strongly correlated than fathers and sons. The survey found that female children were more correlated to their parent\u2019s incomes than were male children \u2013 suggesting that it is easier for boys to break out of the cycle than for girls. It also found that \u201ccorrelation between parent and child labour market earnings is higher for mothers than fathers\u201d \u2013 ie children were more likely to follow the income level of their mother than their father.

      "bodyText": "A former Victorian gaming minister has demanded the state\u2019s gambling regulator investigate allegations aired by Nine against the operator of Melbourne\u2019s casino, Crown Resorts, that include accusations of links to organised crime in China. Tony Robinson, who was minister for gaming in the late 2000s under the Labor premier John Brumby, said the Melbourne casino had the potential to damage the state\u2019s reputation, and the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation must allocate more resources to supervising it. \u201cThe regulator has for too long not applied the powers it has to scrutinise Crown adequately and it\u2019s therefore no surprise to see these sorts of stories emerging,\u201d he said. \u201cRegulatory failure in this instance gives rise to criminal enterprise and serious harm to the state.\u201d His call came as it emerged Crown was warned Chinese authorities were cracking down on illegal gambling promotion, and the company\u2019s staff were warned to avoid electronic communication to minimise the risk of detection, more than a year before 19 staff were arrested by mainland authorities. In other developments, the independent MP and long-time Crown critic Andrew Wilkie, backed by independent senator Jacqui Lambie, called for an investigation into Nine\u2019s claims, to be conducted by one of federal parliament\u2019s joint committees. Crown shares fell 3.24%, or 41c, on Monday to close at $12.26. The VCGLR\u2019s chief executive, Catherine Myers, said the regulator was continuing an existing investigation into Crown\u2019s activities in China that has already been running for two years, but did not say whether it would look into fresh allegations raised in Nine\u2019s report. However, NSW\u2019s gambling regulator, Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW, said it would \u201cwork with other Australian casino regulators to understand if any action should be taken in light of the allegations raised against Crown\u201d. Reports in Nine\u2019s newspapers over the past few days and on its flagship TV current affairs show, 60 Minutes, alleged tens of thousands of leaked internal Crown documents show the casino company has close ties to organised crime through the organisers of junkets run to lure gambling whales from mainland China, where gambling is banned. Nine also accused Crown, which runs casinos in Melbourne and Perth and is building a vast high-roller gambling pit at Barangaroo in Sydney, of putting staff in China at risk. It also claimed the cousin of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, was present on a company jet searched by federal police on suspicion of money laundering in 2016. In addition, the former Australian Border Force head Roman Quaedvlieg told 60 Minutes two government ministers complained to him that Crown\u2019s VIP jets \u201cweren\u2019t receiving a facilitated service for private jets coming into Australia\u201d and \u201cwere seeking some arrangements which smoothed out the processes there a little\u201d. Court records show Crown was warned that Chinese authorities were cracking down on casino marketing in March 2015, more than a year before its staff were arrested and charged with promoting gambling. The 19 Crown workers were later convicted by a Shanghai court. \u201cIt would be well advised to avoid cell phone and text message communications dealing with marketing efforts to the degree possible, and limit overall use while in country,\u201d Crown was told in the report, compiled by US corporate intelligence company Mintz Group. Crown staff should \u201cassume that all communications are either being actively monitored\u201d, Mintz said in the report, excerpts of which were published in a May federal court judgment. \u201cIt is for this reason that a phone call is better than a digital message, simply for the reason that it usually requires live monitoring to be productive for an investigation should one occur.\u201d Nine\u2019s allegations come at a sensitive time for Crown, with the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, James Packer, midway through unloading much of his holding to Hong Kong\u2019s Melco Resorts, headed by his friend and former business partner, Lawrence Ho. Regulators in NSW and Victoria have already flagged probity checks over the involvement in Crown of Ho, whose father Stanley Ho has been banned from involvement with the Barangaroo casino over allegations he has links to triad organised crime groups. There is no suggestion Packer was involved in any of the allegations raised by Nine. The VCGLR\u2019s investigation of Crown\u2019s Chinese imbroglio was delayed after the company told the regulator it would take \u201cmany months\u201d to recover emails sought by officials from back-up tapes. It was not completed by the time the VCGLR published its five-year review of the Melbourne casino license in June last year. \u201cThe VCGLR is continuing to consider the well-publicised events regarding Crown\u2019s international commission-based business and its international sales team in China,\u201d the VCGLR\u2019s Myers said. \u201cThe VCGLR strongly encourages anyone with information related to alleged breaches by the casino operator, to submit this information via this process available on our website.\u201d A Crown spokeswoman said the company \u201cnotes the media reports over the weekend which make various allegations regarding Crown\u2019s business dealings\u201d. \u201cCrown takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities very seriously,\u201d she said. She said the company \u201cdenies any allegation that it knowingly exposed its staff to the risk of detention or conviction in China.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cCrown has a robust process for vetting junket operators with whom it deals and undertakes regular ongoing reviews of these operators in the light of new or additional information that comes to its attention.\u201d The Australian federal police declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about whether it was investigating allegations of money laundering or any other potential federal crimes raised by Nine. \u201cThe AFP does not confirm who it is or is not investigating,\u201d a spokeswoman said.

A home affairs spokeswoman said arrangements allowing people arriving by plane to clear the border without going through an international airport terminal had been in place since before 2016. \u201cTravellers arriving or departing through an off terminal clearance process are required to meet the same border clearance requirements as if entering an international terminal,\u201d she said.",

Ahead of a climate action summit in New York on 23 September, Guterres has reportedly asked leaders to flag plans they will set next year for 2030 emissions reduction commitments, and their plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. A spokesman for the prime minister, Scott Morrison, says Australia will respond formally to the UN chief in due course, but when asked by Guardian Australia what commitments would be outlined, only addressed the 2030 target. The spokesman said the Morrison government recognised \u201cthe serious challenge climate change presents, which is why Australia\u2019s 2030 target is one of the strongest efforts among G20 countries\u201d. \u201cThe government has beaten Australia\u2019s 2020 targets by 367 million tonnes and has already clearly outlined Australia\u2019s plan to meet our 2030 target which will cut the emissions intensity of our economy by two thirds and reduce our emissions per person by half,\u201d Morrison\u2019s spokesman said.

The EU and Canada ahead of the June talks in Bonn also queried the Coalition\u2019s decision to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto Protocol in the carbon budget it outlined before the May election. The Coalition is counting a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet Australia\u2019s 2030 target. Australia\u2019s carbon budget also factors in emissions reduction from the Snowy Hydro expansion; energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy that the government has not yet unveiled; pollution reduction from the rebadged emissions reduction fund and just under 100Mt of abatement from \u201ctechnology solutions\u201d which aren\u2019t specified and \u201cother sources of abatement\u201d such as projects under development but not yet contracted.

Poverty rates also rose using the lower \u201canchored\u201d measure in both 2016 and 2017. Researchers said the trend was likely caused by the \u201ctightening of the screws\u201d of the welfare system, which has seen many Australians moved off higher pension benefits and on to the Newstart allowance. \u201cWe have seen an uptick in measures of poverty in the last couple of years on the back of fairly substantial declines over this century,\u201d said the report\u2019s co-author, Prof Roger Wilkins. \u201cWe\u2019d be a bit concerned about whether that was the start of a trend upwards, or whether it\u2019s just a short-term upward movement.\u201d The survey, which tracks 17,000 households and has been running since 2001, found poverty had increased in 2017 among all family types except couples with children. Child poverty rates among single-parent families hit 19.2% in 2017, the highest rate since the global financial crisis. Poverty rates were even higher among single elderly people, and in excess of 30% for elderly single women, although the report did not take into account owner-occupied housing and was therefore likely to \u201coverstate the extent of their relative deprivation\u201d. The report did not investigate potential causes, but Wilkins said changes to the welfare system introduced by the Coalition and previous Labor government were a likely cause for the increase in poverty rates. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s a lot of attention on the lack of a real increase in the Newstart allowance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s probably not the biggest factor. It would be things like progressively [moving] more people onto Newstart from higher benefits like parenting payment single and the disability support pension.\u201d The report\u2019s findings are still likely to further fuel calls for an increase to the $277.85 a week Newstart payment, which is significantly lower than parenting and disability payments. The relative poverty line is about $430 a week for a single person. Overall, the report notes that \u201ceven among those in relative income poverty, average living standards have increased over the full 17-year period\u201d since 2001.

The previous record of 38.5C was recorded in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003.</p> <p>The recording was taken at a Met Office climate observation site at the University of Cambridge. Some observation sites report monthly, meaning there is still a chance that higher temperatures were recorded elsewhere.</p> <p>Countries across central and western Europe were gripped by exceptionally high temperatures last week, with Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands also breaking national temperature records.</p> <p>Scientists have said July is on track to be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/16/july-on-course-to-be-hottest-month-ever-say-climate-scientists\">hottest month ever recorded</a> on Earth, and 2019 is expected to be the second hottest year. The hottest was 2016, which was boosted by an El Ni\u00f1o weather system.

      "bodyText": "The highest temperature ever recorded in the UK \u2013 38.7C \u2013 has been confirmed by the Met Office. The measurement, taken at Cambridge Botanic Garden last Thursday, was subject to quality control and analysis by meteorologists over the weekend. The previous record of 38.5C was recorded in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003. The recording was taken at a Met Office climate observation site at the University of Cambridge. Some observation sites report monthly, meaning there is still a chance that higher temperatures were recorded elsewhere. Countries across central and western Europe were gripped by exceptionally high temperatures last week, with Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands also breaking national temperature records. Scientists have said July is on track to be the hottest month ever recorded on Earth, and 2019 is expected to be the second hottest year. The hottest was 2016, which was boosted by an El Ni\u00f1o weather system. Nine of the 10 hottest years ever recorded have occurred since 2000. Although the recent heatwave cannot unequivocally be attributed to global heating, scientists found it made another European heatwave in June at least five times more likely, and made the lengthy hot spell experienced by the UK last year at least 30 times more likely. Dr Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said: \u201cHistorically UK summer heatwaves would typically tend to peak in the low 30s celsius, with extreme events reaching the mid-30s. Climate change has increased the likelihood and severity of heatwave episodes across Europe, which will have also increased the risks of a 40C temperature event in the UK.\u201d Last week\u2019s heatwave was caused by hot air from north Africa being pulled up from continental Europe because of high pressure to the east of the UK and low pressure to the west. Prof Peter Stott, from the Met Office, said: \u201cAlthough the average rise of global temperature is around 1C compared with pre-industrial times, we mustn\u2019t forget that the rise isn\u2019t even across the globe as some regions have warmed more than others. \u201cTemperatures in parts of north Africa, for example, have risen by around 2C. This can have a marked effect on UK weather because when the weather patterns like we saw last week bring air from this region to our shores it can bring a stronger signal of climate change with it too, boosting temperatures. \u201cThe UK receives influences from other neighbouring regions and as many of these regions are warming at a faster rate than the UK, our climate can receive a greater boost from climate change.\u201d Many scientists believe the jet stream is weakening, which could help explain the increase in extended weather spells both hot and cold, such as the summer heatwave last year and the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d in March 2018. Bob Ward, the director of policy at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said: \u201cHeatwaves are becoming more frequent and more intense due to climate change, and the risk of heat-related deaths is increasing. Sadly this trend will continue for the next few decades and so we will have to adapt more quickly, for instance by ensuring our buildings do not dangerously overheat. \u201cHowever, we can expect new records to be set regularly. It is inevitable that we will eventually see a temperature of more than 40C in the UK.\u201d More extreme weather is expected to hit the UK this week, with thunderstorms expected on Tuesday and Wednesday. Over the weekend heavy downpours left parts of the north-west flooded, including Greater Manchester where commuters awoke to road closures and diverted trains after two weeks\u2019 worth of rain fell in 24 hours. Eight flood alerts remained in place across parts of the West Midlands and north-west England on Monday evening. Kate Sambrook, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds, said high temperatures like those seen last week could become the new normal. \u201cYear after year we are seeing more and more extreme events, not only in the UK but worldwide.

The Brexit party will also stand, making it more likely the leave vote will split.</p> \n<p>Nigel Dances, 62, a project engineer in the car industry, is a particularly receptive punter on the doorstep.

      "bodyText": "The lush hills and fields of Brecon and Radnorshire, where sheep outnumber people by 10 to one, are fertile ground for a Liberal Democrat revival. Yet in this deeply split constituency, which voted 52% leave, there is no \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d on any Lib Dem leaflet, nor any mention of leaving the EU at all. It may seem odd to omit what has become the Lib Dems\u2019 defining selling point from the literature of its candidate, Jane Dodds, though in between pledging investment in health and social care and delivering for farmers, she promises to \u201cfix our broken and divided politics\u201d \u2013 code for disillusion with the major parties and the failure of Westminster to break the Brexit impasse. Dodds is cautious in the way she talks to voters about Brexit, restricting herself to discussing the perils of no deal and its effect on the constituency\u2019s sheep farming and automotive workers, though she says the party\u2019s stance is hardly a secret. Unlike many MPs, and some of the activists who have come to the constituency to campaign, hoping to help stop Brexit, she says the 2016 referendum made her resolve to listen more. \u201cThe referendum result was a shock, it made me think more than anything though that we need to get out more and talk to more people,\u201d says Dodds, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats. In Brecon and Radnorshire, she says she has found a deep disconnect between its inhabitants and Westminster politics, often a physical one because of a loss of local services and frustration with issues such as broadband infrastructure. No deal will \u201cpotentially decimate\u201d sheep farming, the economic and cultural lifeblood of many communities, she says. \u201cThe first thing that I\u2019m clear about is that a no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table,\u201d says Dodds, drinking coffee in the sunshine in Crickhowell before a day of canvassing. \u201cBut beyond that, people do know what the Lib Dem position is, though \u2013 we aren\u2019t dishonest about that \u2013 and they know we are a remain party who will campaign for a \u2018people\u2019s vote\u2019.\u201d Though Dodds is keen to keep issues local, the vote on Thursday will have huge national significance. Chris Davies, the ousted Conservative MP convicted of expenses fraud, is fighting again for the seat after a byelection was triggered by a recall petition. Should Dodds win, the Conservative majority will dwindle to just one seat, just a week after Boris Johnson was installed as prime minister. Conservative campaigning has been low key, though Johnson is scheduled to visit on Tuesday. There are some nerves about a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d, but Lib Dems are outwardly confident of taking the seat, believing that Davies\u2019 reselection as a candidate is a sign that CCHQ wants a convenient excuse for a loss. The Brexit party will also stand, making it more likely the leave vote will split. Nigel Dances, 62, a project engineer in the car industry, is a particularly receptive punter on the doorstep. For him, a no-deal Brexit would be personal, though he is wary about stopping Brexit entirely. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed it was better to stay in and particularly for my business it would be catastrophic if we had no deal,\u201d he tells Dodds. \u201cThe extra taxes make a huge difference to the margins of the business. But I do believe we need to respect democracy and people voted to come out.

Unfortunately, Jenkins\u2019 forensic demolition of the man still manages to flatter him by taking his classical pretensions seriously. A more relevant and prosaic model for Johnson can be found much closer to home, in the unlikely figure of Harold Macmillan.</p> <p>Both were graduates of Eton and Oxford. Both could claim US citizenship. Both were better known for phrasemaking than policy success, and displayed contradictory, shapeshifting, political qualities. </p> <p>Since Johnson has neither the executive power of Trump with which to realise his narcissistic fantasies, nor the political acumen of Churchill to allow him to assume his hero\u2019s laurels, the comparison with Macmillan (though far from perfect) is both more realistic and suitably modest than the demigods of Johnson\u2019s daydreams.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s promise of a \u201cgolden age\u201d is already claiming squatting rights on Macmillan\u2019s \u201cnever had it so good\u201d territory, so perhaps in a general election we can look forward to talk of \u201cwinds of change\u201d.

He came from a humble background and his parents couldn\u2019t afford to send him to school. In early adulthood he learned to read and write at night school.</p> <p>Later he faced prejudice from the scientific and parliamentary establishment because of his broad Northumberland accent. He made sure his son Robert was taught how to \u201ctalk proper\u201d as a result.</p> <p>And what contributed to Rocket being the winning locomotive at the Rainhill Trials? Well, international exchange and learning of course! Henry Booth, treasurer of the Liverpool and Manchester railway suggested to Robert Stephenson (who was himself back from a stint in South America) that he incorporate the fire-tube boiler, invented by French engineer Marc Seguin, into the Rocket design giving improved heat exchange.</p> <p>Everything about the Stephenson story speaks to the real history of innovation in this land.

      "bodyText": "Simon Jenkins\u2019 portrait of Boris Johnson as a failed Athenian leader is diverting (Is there a Greek hero in No 10, or just a bust?, 27 July). Unfortunately, Jenkins\u2019 forensic demolition of the man still manages to flatter him by taking his classical pretensions seriously. A more relevant and prosaic model for Johnson can be found much closer to home, in the unlikely figure of Harold Macmillan. Both were graduates of Eton and Oxford. Both could claim US citizenship. Both were better known for phrasemaking than policy success, and displayed contradictory, shapeshifting, political qualities. Since Johnson has neither the executive power of Trump with which to realise his narcissistic fantasies, nor the political acumen of Churchill to allow him to assume his hero\u2019s laurels, the comparison with Macmillan (though far from perfect) is both more realistic and suitably modest than the demigods of Johnson\u2019s daydreams. Johnson\u2019s promise of a \u201cgolden age\u201d is already claiming squatting rights on Macmillan\u2019s \u201cnever had it so good\u201d territory, so perhaps in a general election we can look forward to talk of \u201cwinds of change\u201d. Certainly, Johnson is a perfect candidate to inherit the famous comic legend of Supermac: \u201cHow to try to continue to stay top, without actually having been there.\u201d Paul McGilchrist Colchester, Essex \u2022 It is a sure sign of a country that has lost its historical and cultural bearings that Boris Johnson could, without irony, launch a rehashed package of promises for the north of England while standing in front of Stephenson\u2019s Rocket (Boris Johnson pledges \u00a33.6bn boost for deprived towns, 27 July). George Stephenson represented all that is opposite to Johnson. He came from a humble background and his parents couldn\u2019t afford to send him to school. In early adulthood he learned to read and write at night school. Later he faced prejudice from the scientific and parliamentary establishment because of his broad Northumberland accent. He made sure his son Robert was taught how to \u201ctalk proper\u201d as a result. And what contributed to Rocket being the winning locomotive at the Rainhill Trials? Well, international exchange and learning of course! Henry Booth, treasurer of the Liverpool and Manchester railway suggested to Robert Stephenson (who was himself back from a stint in South America) that he incorporate the fire-tube boiler, invented by French engineer Marc Seguin, into the Rocket design giving improved heat exchange. Everything about the Stephenson story speaks to the real history of innovation in this land. The forces that scoffed at the ingenuity of George Stephenson because of his background, meanwhile, are the very ones that Johnson represents today. Dr Olivier Sykes Department of Geography and Planning, University of Liverpool \u2022 Simon Jenkins is absolutely right that Boris Johnson resembles the villainous Alcibiades rather than the heroic Pericles but his idea that Michael Gove \u201cmust become Johnson\u2019s Cassandra, warning him against the danger of his ways\u201d seems somewhat wide of the mark. Jenkins seems to have forgotten that Cassandra was cursed always to be right but never to be believed, so, even if Gove did metamorphose into this mythical Trojan woman of great beauty, her warnings would inevitably be dismissed as the utterances of Project Fear. To add to her frustration, she would also have to deal with Johnson\u2019s priapic instincts but it seems likely that, having previously resisted no less than Apollo, the transformed Gove would survive with virtue intact.

Subsequently she firmed that up into outright opposition to a second poll, a position that Johnson seems to be adopting.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3eff678f08d0b6ca539e8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-29T14:19:41.441Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some more pictures from Boris Johnson\u2019s trip to HM Naval Base Clyde in Faslane.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf78e1e2e5b9ddc1ce861570fec0cd2cba698d3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf78e1e2e5b9ddc1ce861570fec0cd2cba698d3c/0_147_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson (left) visiting HMS Vengeance with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace (right)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson (left) visiting HMS Vengeance with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace (right)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3793671168b50d3bad58d8cd06b0d070d2f0ff1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3793671168b50d3bad58d8cd06b0d070d2f0ff1a/0_198_4283_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ommander Justin Codd accompanies Boris Johnson (right) and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace (centre) as they visit HMS Victorious at HM Naval Base Clyde\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ommander Justin Codd accompanies Boris Johnson (right) and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace (centre) as they visit HMS Victorious at HM Naval Base Clyde</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"221de4cddc5dedc6804ab448dab6d8c346c528d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/221de4cddc5dedc6804ab448dab6d8c346c528d2/0_195_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson meeting crew members in the mess hall of HMS Victorious at HM Naval Base Clyde in Faslane,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson meeting crew members in the mess hall of HMS Victorious at HM Naval Base Clyde in Faslane,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f29ef388818021084daefaed86209231930e9e1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f29ef388818021084daefaed86209231930e9e1f/0_131_4536_2723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson tours the nuclear submarine HMS Victorious at the Naval Base in Faslane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson tours the nuclear submarine HMS Victorious at the Naval Base in Faslane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3eef338f08d0b6ca539dd6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-29T13:59:15.809Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Johnson claims he's willing to go 'extra thousand miles' to get deal with EU - even though No 10 setting precondition for talks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some more lines from what Boris Johnson said when he spoke to reporters at Faslane in Scotland.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson claimed that he was willing to \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to reach a Brexit deal with EU leaders - even though No 10 has set a precondition for talks</strong>.

You need to make decisions about the possible impact of a no deal Brexit, but quite what you do will depend on your judgment about how likely such an outcome is.</p> <p>It would help to have some clarity from government.</p> <p>Yesterday you picked up your copy of the Sunday Times, and there was <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/michael-gove-no-deal-is-a-very-real-prospect-we-must-ensure-we-are-ready-0flpkxkc3\">an article (paywall) </a>by <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He has been put in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, and luckily he had some clear guidance for you.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While we are optimistic about the future, we are realistic about the need to plan for every eventuality. The EU\u2019s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach \u2014 it\u2019s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it.</p> <p>We still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not. The prime minister has been crystal clear that means we must prepare to leave the EU without a deal on October 31, and I fully support this approach.</p> <p>No deal is now a very real prospect, and we must make sure that we are ready. A lot has already been done. Thanks to hard work by ministers past and present, and outstanding efforts by the civil service, we have made significant progress.</p> </blockquote> <p>But in a pooled interview with the BBC\u2019s Scotland editor, <strong>Sarah Smith</strong>, broadcast just now on the BBC and Sky News, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>, the prime minister and Gove\u2019s boss, said the opposite. Here are the key quotes.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he did not accept Gove\u2019s claim that the government was now working on the assumption that a no deal Brexit was the most likely outcome.</strong> Asked about Gove\u2019s assumption, and whether he agreed, Johnson replied: </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, absolutely not. My assumption is that we can get a new deal, we\u2019re aiming for a new deal. But, of course, Michael is absolutely right that it\u2019s responsible for any government to prepare for a no deal if we absolutely have to. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson reasserted his claim that the chances of a no deal Brexit could be as low as a million to one.</strong> Asked if he still stood by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-chances-of-no-deal-brexit-are-a-million-to-one-against\">the claim he made at a Tory leadership hustings about the odds of no deal being a million to one,</a> he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is absolutely right that we should go for a deal, and there is every chance that we can get a deal.

The spokeswoman also denied <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7268563/Boriss-new-bed-taxpayer.html\">a report claiming that Johnson was getting officials to buy him a new bed </a>because, owing to his divorce from his wife, he did not have his own furniture. \u201cThere is no cost to the taxpayer,\u201d the spokeswoman said, when asked about the story, although she refused to give further details of how the flat was being furnished. She also said that she was not aware of Symonds receiving any formal support in her role, as prime ministerial spouses have received in the past, and that there would be no extra cost to the taxpayer from her being in Downing Street.</li> </ul> <p>I will post a full summary of the briefing later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86e1557997a4ec2f34b888ea7e3fd395cc75cf28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86e1557997a4ec2f34b888ea7e3fd395cc75cf28/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, outside Number 10 last week on the day Johnson became PM.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, outside Number 10 last week on the day Johnson became PM.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3ec30e8f08d0b6ca539bc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-29T09:59:34.742Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the Today programme this morning <strong>Sir Oliver Letwin</strong>, one of the Conservative MPs most opposed to a no deal Brexit, confirmed that he had been talking to the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and others about what could be done in parliament to stop this happening.

It was his first Today interview as foreign secretary.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Raab claimed that negotiating a good trade deal with the EU could be \u201cmuch easier\u201d after a no deal Brexit</strong>. He made the point after the interview,<strong> Mishal Husain</strong>, put it to him that, if the UK were to leave the EU with no deal, problems like the backstop, and what to do about the Irish border, would re-emerge as soon as the UK tried to strike a deal with the EU for a long-term trading relationship. Raab replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, over the long term, whether we get a deal before the end of October or whether that\u2019s not possible because the EU sticks very stubbornly to its line, we will want to put the relationship on a firmer footing. It will take both sides to show the pragmatism, the flexibility to make that happen. But I think it will be much easier, for example, to deal with the backstop issue in the context of a free trade agreement than it would under the current arrangements, which are so undemocratic. So actually although there will be risks on all sides of this [from a no deal Brexit], I think the prospects of reverting and getting a good deal for the UK will be easier after we leave, if that\u2019s the case, and the reason being is we will do so as an independent third country and we will be less subject to, effectively, the demands and unilateral dictates of the EU as we are now.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a very much a minority view. Many EU watchers and trade experts believe that that the inevitable acrimony and distrust generated by a no deal Brexit would make a negotiating a good long-term trade deal even harder.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Raab suggested that Boris Johnson will not reopen talks with the EU the summer unless it agrees to drop the backstop</strong>. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/29/brexit-boris-johnson-prime-minister-news-latest-dominic-raab-suggests-boris-johnson-wont-reopen-talks-with-eu-this-summer-until-it-agrees-to-abandon-backstop?page=with:block-5d3ea1528f08d0b6ca539a98#block-5d3ea1528f08d0b6ca539a98\">9.14am.)</a> Asked about what meetings might be taking place, Raab just mentioned the Gymnich, an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers at the end of August. My colleague<strong> Jennifer Rankin</strong> says this meeting is not even about Brexit.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/1155738947634499584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Asked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BBCr4today</a> what UK/EU meetings are coming up, Dominic Raab cites the Gymnich, an EU foreign ministers informal get together, which is not about Brexit.</p>&mdash; Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/1155738947634499584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 29, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>Raab claimed EU intransigence was to blame for the government now having to plan for a no deal Brexit when only last month<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-chances-of-no-deal-brexit-are-a-million-to-one-against\"> Johnson was saying the chances of it happening were \u201ca million to one\u201d.</a></strong> That was Johnson\u2019s line at a Tory leadership hustings. Now the Telegraph is splashing on <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/28/boris-johnsons-100million-brexit-ad-campaign/\">a story (paywall)</a> saying the government is preparing to spend \u00a3100m on an advertising campaign telling people and businesses what they need to do to get read for this eventuality. Asked to explain why Johnson\u2019s assessment of the prospect of no deal happening has changed so dramatically, Raab blamed the EU. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want the deal ... Since the remarks that you have mentioned, we\u2019ve had the series of fairly stubborn positions staked out by the EU. In fairness, you would expect that. It\u2019s only been a few days into this administration. But if they stick to that line - I think the thing that has changed is that they\u2019re not wiling to move at all, and they have reiterated that - then we must be prepared to give the country the finality it needs by preparing both businesses, but also people more broadly, [for a no deal Brexit].</p> </blockquote> <p>Raab was being diplomatic. In truth, there is nothing that the EU is saying now that it was not saying during the Tory leadership campaign. Johnson\u2019s \u201cmillion to one\u201d claim was always misleading and absurd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1155588702128803840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TELEGRAPH: Johnson\u2019s \u00a3100m Brexit ad campaign <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6qQwY7NP0a\">pic.twitter.com/6qQwY7NP0a</a></p>&mdash; Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1155588702128803840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 28, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>Raab said the EU was not \u201cnot the only game in town\u201d for future trade deals, and that he would be travelling to the US, Latin America and Asia to explore opportunities there.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I haven\u2019t set the firm plans yet, but that will include the US, Latin America, and Asia because the negotiation with the EU is crucially important and we would love to get a deal that is acceptable to the UK, but Brussels is not the only game in town. </p> <p>The opportunities of Brexit involve many of those growth markets of the future from Latin America to Asia, and we have got a US President who is speaking very warmly about this country.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to deny a claim <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/preparing-brexit-no-deal-final.pdf\">in today\u2019s report from the Institute for Government (pdf)</a> that a no deal Brexit would require the government to legislate to impose direct rule in Northern Ireland.</strong> Asked if the government would legislate for this, h just said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ll make sure the arrangements are in place so that there is no vacuum, that there\u2019s the efficient conduct of government.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that the Vote Leave campaign has always acknowledged that the UK might have to leave the EU without a deal.</strong> When Husain said Vote Leave had never raised this as a possibility during the 2016 referendum campaign, Raab replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The mandate certainly was not leave the EU if the EU let us.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have spoken to Simon Coveney [the Irish foreign minister] and a range of other European foreign ministers, and will continue those calls, to send the message very clearly we want a deal if there\u2019s a deal to be done, but I don\u2019t think you can just airbrush the fact that the last deal was defeated by the biggest margin in parliamentary history and has led to the resignation of a prime minister.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has contradicted his most senior no deal Brexit planning minister, Michael Gove, by claiming that the government is not working on the basis that a no-deal Brexit is the most likely outcome this autumn. (See 2.23pm.) Boris Johnson is refusing to sit down for talks with EU leaders until they agree to ditch the Irish backstop, despite invitations to meetings from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Johnson himself claimed that he was willing to \u201cgo the extra thousand miles\u201d to engage with EU partners on Brexit. (See 2.59pm.) But his spokeswoman gave what seems to be a more accurate description of his position, saying he did not want to meet EU leaders for Brexit talks until they abandoned the backstop. (See 1.02pm.) Far from going the extra mile, Johnson has not even picked up the phone to Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister and one of the most important EU players on Brexit - a fact that led to Sinn F\u00e9in today accusing Johnson of being \u201coffensive and discourteous\u201d. (See 3.44pm.) The pound has fallen to its lowest level for more than two years as investors react to the escalating no-deal rhetoric of Boris Johnson\u2019s government. European Union officials have rejected Dominic Raab\u2019s claim that negotiating a free-trade deal would be \u201cmuch easier\u201d after a no-deal Brexit. As Jennifer Rankin reports, while the foreign secretary contends that leaving the EU without an agreement would ease the way to solving the disputed Irish border question, European sources fear a no-deal Brexit would trigger an acrimonious blame game. \u201cIt would mean the complete breakdown of political relations and I don\u2019t think there would be much trust on the EU side with the Tories, or with the prime minister,\u201d a senior diplomat said. \u201cEventually we would get around it because we are pragmatic, but this would be really, really bad, because of all the rhetoric around blaming.\u201d Boris Johnson has dropped the Whitehall investigation into Mark Field, the Tory MP who was caught on camera manhandling a Greenpeace activist out of a black-tie dinner. Boris Johnson was booed by protesters as he arrived at Bute House in Edinburgh, the official residence of the first minister, for talks with Nicola Sturgeon. He left later via the back door. Local politicians have said there will be catastrophic job losses if Vauxhall carries out its threat of ending production at its Ellesmere Port factory should Brexit make the site unprofitable. Boris Johnson is moving into Downing Street with his partner, Carrie Symonds, after weeks of speculation about whether she would join him. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been chairing the first meeting of the cabinet\u2019s key Brexit committee, XS (exit strategy - see 1.02pm). Here is the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson on the fact that all six cabinet ministers sitting on it are men. Boris Johnson has now finished his meeting with Nicola Sturgeon. Having been booed by protesters on his way in, he left via the back door, the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley reports. This is what Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, said after her meeting with Boris Johnson. We had an incredibly constructive meeting. We covered a number of areas, talking about Brexit, the need to make sure we can get a deal across the line, and I support the prime minister wholeheartedly in getting that deal. We talked about how we can continue to have the UK government deliver in Scotland, for Scots, and how we can build on that delivery, and also how we can continue to take on Nicola Sturgeon and oppose her obsession with another independence referendum. Here are more pictures of Boris Johnson meeting Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Here they are on the doorstep of Bute House, the first minister\u2019s official residence. And here they are inside. There\u2019s a pretty bracing difference in tone between the prime minister\u2019s words in person at Faslane this morning, and what his official spokesperson was telling reporters at a lobby briefing in Westminster at almost exactly the same time. Asked about Dominic Raab\u2019s suggestion that Johnson was ruling out re-opening negotiations unless he could ditch the backstop (see 9.14am), Boris Johnson said: I believe in reaching out. I\u2019ve already been talking to colleagues around the table in Brussels. I have absolutely no inhibitions about that. We are not going to be aloof or wait for our friends to come to us. Yet in London, the tone was far less emollient, with his official spokesperson insisting the prime minister had made clear that he wanted to strike a deal, but there was no point in holding face-to-face talks unless the EU agreed to reopen the withdrawal agreement. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, did not seem very thrilled to have Boris Johnson on her doorstep, the BBC\u2019s Philip Sim points out. Boris Johnson was booed as he arrived at Bute House in Edinburgh for talks with Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister. Here is the clip from the BBC\u2019s Lynsey Bews. Jeremy Corbyn has released a new video accusing Boris Johnson of having no plan for the country. Among the many criticisms Corbyn makes of Johnson, he claims Johnson is staking the country\u2019s future on a trade deal with the US that would risk the takeover of the NHS by American corporations. Ministers are sensitive to this charge. In an article in this morning\u2019s Telegraph (paywall), Liz Truss, the new international trade secretary, confirms that a UK-US trade deal is a priority, but she makes a point of adding: \u201cAt the outset of this process, I want to make it clear that [a trade deal] will never mean putting our NHS up for sale.\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in has said that Boris Johnson\u2019s failure so far to speak to Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, is \u201cdiscourteous and offensive\u201d. This morning, Downing Street confirmed that, five days on from becoming prime minister, Johnson still had not spoken to Varadkar, who is crucial to any EU decision on the backstop. (See 1.02pm.) Michelle O\u2019Neill, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader in Northern Ireland, raised this in a meeting with Julian Smith, the new Northern Ireland secretary, at Stormont. Speaking after the meeting O\u2019Neill said: I would judge that it is highly discourteous that the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not engaging with the Taoiseach. That is highly offensive given the disastrous impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland. O\u2019Neill also said Smith had not offered an explanation as to why Johnson and Varadkar had not spoken yet. Speaking to reporters at Faslane Boris Johnson also suggested he would refuse to agree to Scotland holding another independence referendum. Asked if he would rule out a second referendum, Johnson replied: It was a once in a generation consultation of the people, we did it in 2014 and the people were assured then that it was a once in a generation consultation. I see no reason now for the politicians to go back on that promise ... Everybody made clear at the time in 2014, even the Scottish Nationalist Party, I seem to recollect, said that this was a once in a generation vote and I think that the confidence of the public in politicians would be undermined yet further if we were to go back on that and hold another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said the vote for Brexit justifies a second independence referendum (in 2014 the UK government said Scotland was most likely to stay in the EU if it voted against independence) and she has introduced a bill in the Scottish parliament that would pave the way for one to happen. But for a referendum to be legally binding, it would need Westminster approval. When Sturgeon first floated the idea of a second independence referendum, the then prime minister, Theresa May, said that \u201cnow is not the time\u201d. Subsequently she firmed that up into outright opposition to a second poll, a position that Johnson seems to be adopting. Here are some more pictures from Boris Johnson\u2019s trip to HM Naval Base Clyde in Faslane. Here are some more lines from what Boris Johnson said when he spoke to reporters at Faslane in Scotland. Johnson claimed that he was willing to \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to reach a Brexit deal with EU leaders - even though No 10 has set a precondition for talks. Asked if he was planning to meet EU leaders personally to try to find a solution to Brexit, he replied: Look, my approach is to be very outward-going. I don\u2019t want the UK to be aloof or hanging back. I want us to engage, to hold out the hand, to go the extra mile, the extra thousand miles. An what we want to do is to make it absolutely clear that the backstop is no good, it\u2019s deal, it has got to go. The withdrawal agreement is dead, it\u2019s got to go. But there is scope to do a new deal. He also said: In our approach to the negotiations we are not going to be aloof, we are not going to be stand-offish, we\u2019re are not going to wait for our friends to come to us. We are going to reach out, we are going to engage and we\u2019re going to ask for obviously very, very profound changes to the current basis for leaving the EU. The present withdrawal agreement is dead, the backstop must go, but once the backstop goes then it might be possible for progress to be made. But at the No 10 lobby briefing this morning his spokeswoman said he did not want to meet EU leaders until they had agreed in advance to change the withdrawal agreement. (See 1.02pm.) He claimed that with Theresa May as prime minister the EU did not really know what the UK wanted. Asked why he thought he would be able to reach a deal when she failed, he said he was being very clear about wanting to come out of the customs union and the single market. He went on: The funny thing is for the last three years it hasn\u2019t really been at all clear that that was the position of the UK government. There\u2019s no point in coming out of the EU if you\u2019re going to end up being run by the EU. And that was the result of the backstop. So I think to a large extent Brussels was a bit baffled by what the UK position really was. There was no clear decision. He played down the significance of the warning from PSA that its Vauxhall car plant at Ellesemere Port could close in the event of Brexit. He said the automative sector was suffering from \u201call sorts of difficulties\u201d, not least caused by diesel, and that other car markers were investing in the UK. Imagine that you are the CEO of a large company. You need to make decisions about the possible impact of a no deal Brexit, but quite what you do will depend on your judgment about how likely such an outcome is. It would help to have some clarity from government. Yesterday you picked up your copy of the Sunday Times, and there was an article (paywall) by Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He has been put in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, and luckily he had some clear guidance for you. While we are optimistic about the future, we are realistic about the need to plan for every eventuality. The EU\u2019s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach \u2014 it\u2019s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it. We still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not. The prime minister has been crystal clear that means we must prepare to leave the EU without a deal on October 31, and I fully support this approach. No deal is now a very real prospect, and we must make sure that we are ready. A lot has already been done. Thanks to hard work by ministers past and present, and outstanding efforts by the civil service, we have made significant progress. But in a pooled interview with the BBC\u2019s Scotland editor, Sarah Smith, broadcast just now on the BBC and Sky News, Boris Johnson, the prime minister and Gove\u2019s boss, said the opposite. Here are the key quotes. Johnson said he did not accept Gove\u2019s claim that the government was now working on the assumption that a no deal Brexit was the most likely outcome. Asked about Gove\u2019s assumption, and whether he agreed, Johnson replied: No, absolutely not. My assumption is that we can get a new deal, we\u2019re aiming for a new deal. But, of course, Michael is absolutely right that it\u2019s responsible for any government to prepare for a no deal if we absolutely have to. Johnson reasserted his claim that the chances of a no deal Brexit could be as low as a million to one. Asked if he still stood by the claim he made at a Tory leadership hustings about the odds of no deal being a million to one, he replied: I think it is absolutely right that we should go for a deal, and there is every chance that we can get a deal. And I think with goodwill and with common sense, that is what we will achieve. When pressed again on whether he stood by his one million to one claim, Johnson replied: Provided there is sufficient goodwill and common sense on the part of our partners, that is exactly where I would put the odds. I will post more from the clip soon. Downing Street has confirmed that a Cabinet Office investigation into Mark Field, who was suspended as a Foreign Office minister after grabbing a female Greenpeace protester around the neck at the chancellor\u2019s Manson House speech, has been dropped. Field referred himself to the Cabinet Office to \u201cexamine if there has been a breach of the ministerial code\u201d. But Field then lost his job in the reshuffle after Boris Johnson became prime minister. Asked about the status of the inquiry, Downing Street said: The current PM considers this issue was a matter for the previous PM concerning his conduct during his time as a minister under her appointment. This is how the pound has been responding to the news that the government is ramping up its plans for a no deal Brexit. Here are the main points from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman claimed that Boris Johnson was \u201cconfident\u201d that the EU would agree to change the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Asked if he still thought that the chances of a no deal Brexit were still a million to one, the spokeswoman replied: I think he has been clear that the backstop has to be abolished. He remains confident that the EU will stop claiming that the withdrawal agreement cannot be changed. But until that happens we must assume that there will be a no deal Brexit on 31 October. The spokeswoman confirmed that Johnson does not want to meet EU leaders to discuss Brexit until they agree to abandon the backstop. Others in government have been implying as much for some says now (see 9.14am), but today Downing Street was more explicit about this than it has been in the past. The spokeswoman said: The PM has been clear that he wants to meet EU leaders and negotiate, but not to sit down and be told that the EU cannot possibly reopen the withdrawal agreement. And that is the message that he has been giving to leaders when he has spoken to them on the telephone so far ... The EU has said up to now it is not willing to renegotiate [the backstop] ... The prime minister would be happy to sit down with leaders when that position changes. But he is making it clear to everybody he speaks to that that needs to happen. The spokeswoman defended Johnson\u2019s decision to describe the backstop as \u201cundemocratic\u201d. Theresa May did not label it as such, but Johnson and his new ministers have repeatedly been referring to it as the \u201cundemocratic backstop\u201d. The spokeswoman said that this was a reference to \u201cthe challenge of leaving it\u201d, but she said the prime minister had also complained about the way the backstop would keep the UK tied to customs union and single market rules. The spokeswoman confirmed that the government is planning an extensive publicity campaign to prepare the public for a no deal Brexit. She said: You can expect to see an ambitious, active public awareness campaign, backed by necessary funding, and that is to ensure that businesses and citizens have the information that they need to adequately prepare [for a no deal Brexit]. The spokeswoman said Johnson is moving into Downing Street with his partner, Carrie Symonds. (See 11.59am.) Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, will chair a meeting of the cabinet\u2019s new EU exit strategy (XS) committee this afternoon, the spokeswoman said. This is the body that has been described as the Brexit war cabinet in the press. Normally chaired by Johnson, the other members are Gove, Sajid Javid, the chancellor, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general. It is due to meet twice a week. Another committee, chaired by Gove, will deal with Brexit daily operations (XO). That is due to meet daily, starting tomorrow. There will also be a third Brexit cabinet committee, dealing with the economy and trade. Downing Street is due to publish a full list of the members of these committees later today. The spokeswoman confirmed that Johnson has not yet spoken to Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister). She would not say why, beyond saying that Johnson has been travelling quite a lot and that he will be having further calls with EU leaders in the coming days. The spokeswoman refused to deny a claim in today\u2019s report from the Institute for Government (pdf) that a no deal Brexit would require the government to legislate to impose direct rule in Northern Ireland. The spokeswoman said she was not aware of any plans for the full cabinet to meet this week. The spokeswoman said the government reshuffle was almost over, but she said that some whip appointments have yet to be announced. A Brexit party bus has been towed after it was pictured empty with its doors open on the side of a road in Wales. After pictures were shared on Twitter of the bus blocking a lay-by in the Brecon Beacons on Saturday night, some speculated it had been left there as a \u201cbizarre publicity stunt\u201d, but the party has confirmed that it suffered a mechanical failure, the Press Association reports. From the BBC\u2019s Sue Charles Veterans will be represented in cabinet under plans set out by Boris Johnson, the Press Association reports. Oliver Dowden, the paymaster general and Cabinet Office minister, will be given the role. He will work closely with former soldier Johnny Mercer, who has been appointed Minister for Defence People and Veterans. They will oversee a new Office of Veterans\u2019 Affairs to coordinate Whitehall departments in addressing the challenges facing former armed forces personnel. In a statement Johnson said: The brave men and women who serve in our military truly represent the pinnacle of British character. We are rightly admired throughout the world for our armed forces, and it is a stain on our national conscience that any veteran who has served should be abandoned by the country they have fought so courageously to protect. The announcement meets one of three demands set out by the Sun newspaper, which has been enthusiastically backing Johnson, in a campaign it has been running for veterans. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon says that she will press Boris Johnson on the damage that a no deal Brexit will do to the Scottish economy, when she meets the prime minister later this afternoon. Speaking ahead of the first face-to-face meeting between the first minister and the new prime minister, Sturgeon said: The people of Scotland did not vote for this Tory government, they didn\u2019t vote for this new prime minister, they didn\u2019t vote for Brexit and they certainly didn\u2019t vote for a catastrophic no-deal Brexit which Boris Johnson is now planning for. Boris Johnson has formed a hard-line Tory government with one aim \u2013 to take Scotland and the UK out of the EU without a deal. Scotland has been ignored throughout the Brexit process and it is now time for everyone who cares about the future of Scotland to come together to chart our own course and say to the Tories \u2013 stop driving our country towards disaster. I\u2019m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Mostly it was a routine affair, that did not shed a lot of new light on what the administration is up to, but the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman did have at least one mini story for the hacks. Boris Johnson will be living with his partner, Carrie Symonds, in Downing Street, Number 10 has confirmed. He will be officially move in today, and Symonds will be living there with him, the spokeswoman confirmed. They will be living in the four-bedroom flat above 11 Downing Street, which prime ministers since Tony Blair have been using because it is much bigger than the flat above 10 Downing Street, which now gets used by the chancellor. The spokeswoman also denied a report claiming that Johnson was getting officials to buy him a new bed because, owing to his divorce from his wife, he did not have his own furniture. \u201cThere is no cost to the taxpayer,\u201d the spokeswoman said, when asked about the story, although she refused to give further details of how the flat was being furnished. She also said that she was not aware of Symonds receiving any formal support in her role, as prime ministerial spouses have received in the past, and that there would be no extra cost to the taxpayer from her being in Downing Street. I will post a full summary of the briefing later. On the Today programme this morning Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the Conservative MPs most opposed to a no deal Brexit, confirmed that he had been talking to the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and others about what could be done in parliament to stop this happening. Letwin said: There are all sorts of talks going on between everybody and everybody else, and there will continue to be between now and October ... It is certainly true we have all been talking to one another, I have been doing that for months and months as all of us have. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. This is from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, on the Daily Telegraph story (paywall) about the government spending up to \u00a3100m telling people and businesses what they need to do to prepare for a no deal Brexit. Here are the main points from Dominic Raab\u2019s Today interview relating to Brexit. It was his first Today interview as foreign secretary. Raab claimed that negotiating a good trade deal with the EU could be \u201cmuch easier\u201d after a no deal Brexit. He made the point after the interview, Mishal Husain, put it to him that, if the UK were to leave the EU with no deal, problems like the backstop, and what to do about the Irish border, would re-emerge as soon as the UK tried to strike a deal with the EU for a long-term trading relationship. Raab replied: Of course, over the long term, whether we get a deal before the end of October or whether that\u2019s not possible because the EU sticks very stubbornly to its line, we will want to put the relationship on a firmer footing. It will take both sides to show the pragmatism, the flexibility to make that happen. But I think it will be much easier, for example, to deal with the backstop issue in the context of a free trade agreement than it would under the current arrangements, which are so undemocratic. So actually although there will be risks on all sides of this [from a no deal Brexit], I think the prospects of reverting and getting a good deal for the UK will be easier after we leave, if that\u2019s the case, and the reason being is we will do so as an independent third country and we will be less subject to, effectively, the demands and unilateral dictates of the EU as we are now. This is a very much a minority view. Many EU watchers and trade experts believe that that the inevitable acrimony and distrust generated by a no deal Brexit would make a negotiating a good long-term trade deal even harder. Raab suggested that Boris Johnson will not reopen talks with the EU the summer unless it agrees to drop the backstop. (See 9.14am.) Asked about what meetings might be taking place, Raab just mentioned the Gymnich, an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers at the end of August. My colleague Jennifer Rankin says this meeting is not even about Brexit. Raab claimed EU intransigence was to blame for the government now having to plan for a no deal Brexit when only last month Johnson was saying the chances of it happening were \u201ca million to one\u201d. That was Johnson\u2019s line at a Tory leadership hustings. Now the Telegraph is splashing on a story (paywall) saying the government is preparing to spend \u00a3100m on an advertising campaign telling people and businesses what they need to do to get read for this eventuality. Asked to explain why Johnson\u2019s assessment of the prospect of no deal happening has changed so dramatically, Raab blamed the EU. He said: We want the deal ... Since the remarks that you have mentioned, we\u2019ve had the series of fairly stubborn positions staked out by the EU. In fairness, you would expect that. It\u2019s only been a few days into this administration. But if they stick to that line - I think the thing that has changed is that they\u2019re not wiling to move at all, and they have reiterated that - then we must be prepared to give the country the finality it needs by preparing both businesses, but also people more broadly, [for a no deal Brexit]. Raab was being diplomatic. In truth, there is nothing that the EU is saying now that it was not saying during the Tory leadership campaign. Johnson\u2019s \u201cmillion to one\u201d claim was always misleading and absurd. Raab said the EU was not \u201cnot the only game in town\u201d for future trade deals, and that he would be travelling to the US, Latin America and Asia to explore opportunities there. He said: I haven\u2019t set the firm plans yet, but that will include the US, Latin America, and Asia because the negotiation with the EU is crucially important and we would love to get a deal that is acceptable to the UK, but Brussels is not the only game in town. The opportunities of Brexit involve many of those growth markets of the future from Latin America to Asia, and we have got a US President who is speaking very warmly about this country. He refused to deny a claim in today\u2019s report from the Institute for Government (pdf) that a no deal Brexit would require the government to legislate to impose direct rule in Northern Ireland. Asked if the government would legislate for this, h just said: We\u2019ll make sure the arrangements are in place so that there is no vacuum, that there\u2019s the efficient conduct of government. He claimed that the Vote Leave campaign has always acknowledged that the UK might have to leave the EU without a deal. When Husain said Vote Leave had never raised this as a possibility during the 2016 referendum campaign, Raab replied: The mandate certainly was not leave the EU if the EU let us. It was an in/out referendum and we made clear, those on the campaign, that we should strive for a good deal, but if that wasn\u2019t available, that we should go on and make a success of Brexit. Raab also claimed that in interviews at the time he and other Vote Leave figures had repeatedly said, if a deal could not be struck, the UK might have to leave without one. Husain said she did not remember this, and Raab replied with a swipe at the BBC. In fairness, the institutional memory of the BBC is a bit sketchy on this as a whole, so you are not alone. The FT\u2019s Henry Mance says other leavers side with Husain. Before Boris Johnson became prime minister there was speculation that as soon as he took office he would be on the plane to Brussels, Paris and Berlin to open talks with EU leaders about his demands for a new Brexit deal. On Friday the German government even said Johnson had accepted an invitation to visit Angela Merkel \u201cin the near future\u201d. But Number 10 itself has been playing down the prospect of talks opening soon, today\u2019s Daily Mail says Johnson has no plans to visit EU capitals this summer, and that there might be no significant talks with Brussels until the EU summit starting on 17 October, and in an interview on the Today programme this morning the new foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, all but confirmed this. Asked if Johnson had any plans to visit EU capitals, Raab said there were a whole series of meetings coming up, but the only one he mentioned was the Gymnich, an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers at the end of August. Raab ignored a question about whether Johnson would be visiting EU capitals before that, and he implied that Johnson has not even spoken yet to Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, who is central to any decision taken by the EU in relation to the backstop. Raab then suggested that there was no point in the UK opening talks until the EU agrees to abandon the backstop. He said: I have spoken to Simon Coveney [the Irish foreign minister] and a range of other European foreign ministers, and will continue those calls, to send the message very clearly we want a deal if there\u2019s a deal to be done, but I don\u2019t think you can just airbrush the fact that the last deal was defeated by the biggest margin in parliamentary history and has led to the resignation of a prime minister. It is not just going to revert to where we left off the last negotiations. There must be some change from the EU. And if the EU are not willing to move at all, we must be willing to ready to give the country some finality. Number 10 has repeatedly said that the \u201cchange\u201d required from the EU is the removal of the backstop from the withdrawal agreement. I will post more from the interview shortly. Today we have got a lobby briefing from Number 10 at 11am. Johnson himself is in Scotland, where he is visiting a military base this morning, before going to Edinburgh in the afternoon for talks with Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, and Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Many of them have been mistreated or in extreme cases tortured, they say.</p> <p>\u201cIt should not be the choice of the foreign secretary to act to protect a British citizen abroad but rather the obligation,\u201d they write, urging the prime minister to \u201ccorrect past mistakes and fight for the rights and protections due to all British citizens.\u201d.</p> <p>The group says even when diplomatic assistance is provided, it can be inconsistent.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Imam Khomeini airport in Tehran in April 2016 and accused of spying, an allegation she denies.

It\u2019s a crucial gap in the way you\u2019re protected. A case like Nazanin\u2019s shows that really clearly. This is an innocent mum and baby and it took two years for the government to say she\u2019s innocent.\u201d</p> <p>He suggested that at present political considerations could prevail over the welfare of the individual. \u201cBecause it\u2019s discretionary, because the government can choose to protect or not, it means if it\u2019s feeling cautious, it won\u2019t do very much until really pushed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Johnson has faced criticism for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/06/boris-johnson-mistake-could-harm-case-for-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-say-family\">his role in the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a>. To her family\u2019s consternation, Johnson, while foreign secretary, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/06/boris-johnson-mistake-could-harm-case-for-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-say-family\">had been teaching journalism</a> in Tehran.</p> <p>However, Zaghari-Ratcliffe says she was in Iran to visit her family and her account was backed by her employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organisation that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and Reuters News.</p> <p>Hedges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/27/matthew-hedges-jailed-academic-returns-to-uk-after-uae-pardon\">was pardoned last year</a> after seven months in jail in the UAE, having been sentenced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/british-academic-matthew-hedges-accused-of-spying-jailed-for-life-in-uae\">life in prison</a> for spying,</p> <p>His wife, Daniela Tejada, said: \u201cOne day I will be the mother of a British child and I want to know that no other Briton will have to go through the months of agony that my husband and I did when he was unfairly detained and tortured abroad last year.\u201d</p> <p>The other relatives who make up the British Rights Abroad Group are the families of Jagtar Singh Johal, who has been detained in India for 22 months, Andy Tsege, who was detained in Ethiopia for almost four years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/andargachew-tsege-ethiopia-briton-death-row-release-facebook\">before being released last year</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/10/chennai-sixs-billy-irving-can-never-forgive-uk-government\">Billy Irving</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/10/chennai-sixs-billy-irving-can-never-forgive-uk-government\">, who was released in 2017</a> after almost five years imprisoned in India.</p> <p>They have launched <a href=\"http://change.org/britishrightsabroad\">a petition</a> urging MPs and political parties to make consular protection a manifesto commitment and ultimately enshrine it in law.</p> <p>An FCO spokesperson said: \u201cWe provide our assistance consistently to all those we support.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "British citizens imprisoned abroad should have a legal right to consular protection, families of current and former detainees including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Matthew Hedges have said. Consular protection is offered on a discretionary basis but the newly formed British Rights Abroad Group says the Foreign Office (FCO) should have a duty to provide assistance in all cases. In a letter to Boris Johnson, the families say more than 2,000 British citizens are being held overseas, about 1,000 of whom are being held without trial. Many of them have been mistreated or in extreme cases tortured, they say. \u201cIt should not be the choice of the foreign secretary to act to protect a British citizen abroad but rather the obligation,\u201d they write, urging the prime minister to \u201ccorrect past mistakes and fight for the rights and protections due to all British citizens.\u201d. The group says even when diplomatic assistance is provided, it can be inconsistent. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Imam Khomeini airport in Tehran in April 2016 and accused of spying, an allegation she denies. The Iranian-British dual national remains in prison in the Iranian capital after being sentenced to five years in jail in September 2016. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the families had been galvanised into setting up the organisation because of the new government led by Johnson, who as foreign secretary was involved in many of the cases, particularly that of Ratcliffe\u2019s wife. \u201cThere are common frustrations,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cParticularly in the early stages the Foreign Office didn\u2019t do enough to protect our family members and wasn\u2019t pro-active enough. It\u2019s a crucial gap in the way you\u2019re protected. A case like Nazanin\u2019s shows that really clearly. This is an innocent mum and baby and it took two years for the government to say she\u2019s innocent.\u201d He suggested that at present political considerations could prevail over the welfare of the individual. \u201cBecause it\u2019s discretionary, because the government can choose to protect or not, it means if it\u2019s feeling cautious, it won\u2019t do very much until really pushed,\u201d he said. Johnson has faced criticism for his role in the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. To her family\u2019s consternation, Johnson, while foreign secretary, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Tehran. However, Zaghari-Ratcliffe says she was in Iran to visit her family and her account was backed by her employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organisation that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and Reuters News. Hedges was pardoned last year after seven months in jail in the UAE, having been sentenced to life in prison for spying, His wife, Daniela Tejada, said: \u201cOne day I will be the mother of a British child and I want to know that no other Briton will have to go through the months of agony that my husband and I did when he was unfairly detained and tortured abroad last year.\u201d The other relatives who make up the British Rights Abroad Group are the families of Jagtar Singh Johal, who has been detained in India for 22 months, Andy Tsege, who was detained in Ethiopia for almost four years before being released last year, and Billy Irving, who was released in 2017 after almost five years imprisoned in India. They have launched a petition urging MPs and political parties to make consular protection a manifesto commitment and ultimately enshrine it in law. An FCO spokesperson said: \u201cWe provide our assistance consistently to all those we support.\u201d",

The project to build a 73-mile east-west rail line across London is funded by the Department for Transport and Transport for London (TfL), the capital\u2019s public transport authority. The documents show how the security company compiled weekly reports on the trade unionists who were seeking justice for blacklisted workers. Control Risks tracked their campaign, analysing their tactics and the impact of their protests. It identified influential figures in the anti-blacklisting campaign and its potential future activity. The trade unionists were supporting an electrician who said he had been blacklisted and sacked from the Crossrail project. In 2009, a watchdog closed down a blacklist funded by the construction industry containing files on thousands of workers they deemed to be troublemakers. Trade unionists campaigned to get compensation for those who had been denied jobs for long periods. Crossrail has denied using blacklisting on the project. Managers have been criticised for spending money on monitoring the trade unionists when their project has run almost \u00a33bn over budget and its opening has been heavily delayed. The decision to hire Control Risks would have been authorised by Chris Sexton, the project\u2019s technical director until last year, according to TfL. He has since been promoted to be its deputy chief executive. The reports of the monitoring operation \u2013 codenamed Project Galahad \u2013 were sent to senior Crossrail executives. Control Risks was paid \u00a347,857 in 2013 and \u00a311,309 in 2010, according to TfL.

It styles itself as \u201ca specialist global risk consultancy\u201d, giving advice to large corporations, carrying out investigations and providing security to governments and security for companies. It is understood to recruit former spies and military personnel. Some documents about the monitoring were obtained by Frank Morris, the electrician, under the Data Protection Act. With the support of the trade unionists, Morris campaigned to get his job back at the Crossrail project after he said he had been blacklisted and dismissed for voicing safety concerns. His claim was rejected by Crossrail, which said Morris was among 28 workers made redundant when a section of work had been completed. The documents obtained by Morris show Control Risks monitored him and other anti-blacklisting campaigners between May and September 2013, drawing on material on the internet. One exchange of emails show Crossrail asking Control Risks how many protesters were going to demonstrate at a court hearing at which Morris was taking legal action.

The Met\u2019s counter-terrorism command has assumed leadership of the investigation.</p> <p>More than 60 properties were evacuated after the items were discovered. Police set up a 100-metre cordon around the property shortly before 1pm while an army bomb disposal team, supported by Suffolk fire and rescue crews, made the site safe.</p> <p>The suspect is being questioned at a Suffolk police station, having been detained at about 12.10pm on Sunday under section 41 of the Terrorism Act, 2000. The Met said the grenades were found to be inert and the gun was believed to be an imitation firearm.</p> <p>Det Ch Supt Alexis Boon, of counter-terrorism command, said: \u201cAfter a pre-planned operation by Suffolk constabulary in which officers arrested a man, the Met police counter-terrorism command is now leading this investigation, working closely with police in Suffolk.</p> <p>\u201cSuffolk constabulary acted quickly to make the area safe, including erecting a cordon around the address as a precautionary measure while enquiries are ongoing. However, we have found nothing to suggest an ongoing threat to the public.\u201d</p> <p>Police said the cordon was lifted on Sunday evening and only the house where the items were discovered, as well as three other neighbouring properties, remained inaccessible to the public.</p> <p>They said officers from Suffolk constabulary\u2019s safer neighbourhood teams would remain at the scene over the next few days to provide reassurance to residents.</p> <p>Chloe Marie Cullen, 23, who had to leave her flat on neighbouring Normanston Drive, told the BBC: \u201cI heard lots of sirens then I saw the police walking up the road towards the house, but I stayed calm as they seemed to have it under control. The police told me to pack an overnight bag as there\u2019s a chance we might not be able to get back in this evening.\u201d</p> <p>Shaun Waters, the landlord of the Norman Warrior pub in the town, said a number of residents had headed to the pub to seek refuge. \u201cThey\u2019ve been told to go to the sports centre for the night, but a lot are waiting to be picked up by family instead,\u201d he told the BBC.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit of blitz spirit at first but now people are starting to think about work [on Monday] and not being able to get back to their houses.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A man has been arrested on suspicion of a terrorism offence after two military grenades, a gun and chemicals were found at a house in Suffolk. Officers from Suffolk constabulary made the discovery on Sunday afternoon while executing an arrest warrant at a property in Lowestoft. A 59-year-old man was initially arrested on Sunday on suspicion of a firearms offence before being further arrested on Monday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. The Met\u2019s counter-terrorism command has assumed leadership of the investigation. More than 60 properties were evacuated after the items were discovered. Police set up a 100-metre cordon around the property shortly before 1pm while an army bomb disposal team, supported by Suffolk fire and rescue crews, made the site safe. The suspect is being questioned at a Suffolk police station, having been detained at about 12.10pm on Sunday under section 41 of the Terrorism Act, 2000. The Met said the grenades were found to be inert and the gun was believed to be an imitation firearm. Det Ch Supt Alexis Boon, of counter-terrorism command, said: \u201cAfter a pre-planned operation by Suffolk constabulary in which officers arrested a man, the Met police counter-terrorism command is now leading this investigation, working closely with police in Suffolk. \u201cSuffolk constabulary acted quickly to make the area safe, including erecting a cordon around the address as a precautionary measure while enquiries are ongoing. However, we have found nothing to suggest an ongoing threat to the public.\u201d Police said the cordon was lifted on Sunday evening and only the house where the items were discovered, as well as three other neighbouring properties, remained inaccessible to the public. They said officers from Suffolk constabulary\u2019s safer neighbourhood teams would remain at the scene over the next few days to provide reassurance to residents. Chloe Marie Cullen, 23, who had to leave her flat on neighbouring Normanston Drive, told the BBC: \u201cI heard lots of sirens then I saw the police walking up the road towards the house, but I stayed calm as they seemed to have it under control. The police told me to pack an overnight bag as there\u2019s a chance we might not be able to get back in this evening.\u201d Shaun Waters, the landlord of the Norman Warrior pub in the town, said a number of residents had headed to the pub to seek refuge. \u201cThey\u2019ve been told to go to the sports centre for the night, but a lot are waiting to be picked up by family instead,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIt was a bit of blitz spirit at first but now people are starting to think about work [on Monday] and not being able to get back to their houses.\u201d",

With Hockenheim their stage, the team were determined to mark their home race with a flourish. They had made an admirable effort to ensure it was memorable and it was.

Honouring his contract until the start of next summer\u2019s transfer window will set them back about \u00a328.8m. Getting stuck with Bale for the 1,068 days between now and his deal expiring in 2022 will cost them a shade under \u00a392m. Even The Fiver\u2019s astonishingly basic understanding of maths is enough to see that nothing, while not being an overwhelming amount of money for such a renowned player, is nevertheless quite a lot more than -\u00a392m. Meanwhile, it seems that half of Madrid is pushing in one direction while the other half pulls the other way, and that kind of behaviour never leads to a happy ending, except, that is, for gazelle/chamois/unicorn crosses in vintage child-friendly fiction.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s a pre-season friendly?

The fee will be \u20ac80m (\u00a372m) plus add-ons for the Ivory Coast international. Once the final details are settled and a medical taken, Arsenal expect to confirm P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s arrival. Napoli were among other clubs who had hoped to buy the 24-year-old, who is left-footed but prefers to play on the right side of a front three. P\u00e9p\u00e9 scored 22 goals in the French league last season, second to Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, and provided 11 assists. Arsenal\u2019s record fee is the \u00a356m paid to buy Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018.",

Over July the pound has lost 3.6% at the time of writing, while against the euro the pound has lost 1.3% today, trading below \u20ac1.10 at points.</p> <p>\u201cPolitics should remain the key negative for sterling in the months to come,\u201d said <strong>Petr Krpata</strong>, chief EMEA foreign exchange and interest rates strategist at <strong>ING</strong>, the investment bank.

My assumption is that we can get a new deal, we\u2019re aiming for a new deal. But, of course, Michael is absolutely right that it\u2019s responsible for any government to prepare for a no deal if we absolutely have to.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also doubled down on a claim that the odds of a no-deal Brexit were a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-chances-of-no-deal-brexit-are-a-million-to-one-against\">million to one</a>.

The FTSE 100\u2019s <strong>Just Eat</strong> and Dutch Takeaway.com have agreed a \u00a38.2bn all-share deal to create one of the world\u2019s biggest takeaway delivery players.

      "bodyText": "The end of July may usually be a fairly sleepy time on financial markets, as investors head out on holiday, but this summer is already gearing up to be a nail-biter as the UK gears up for a no-deal Brexit. Sterling is on track for its worst day since March, giving the new government under Boris Johnson a taste of what would happen if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The pound traded at a low of $1.2243 against the US dollar on Monday afternoon, a fall of 1.1% today. Over July the pound has lost 3.6% at the time of writing, while against the euro the pound has lost 1.3% today, trading below \u20ac1.10 at points. \u201cPolitics should remain the key negative for sterling in the months to come,\u201d said Petr Krpata, chief EMEA foreign exchange and interest rates strategist at ING, the investment bank. He said: If Boris Johnson\u2019s government presses for a no deal Brexit, the most likely outcome will be a no confidence vote in Parliament. This could, in turn, translate into an early general election (which would most likely be accompanied by an Article 50 extension). However, there appears to be some confusion about the government\u2019s exact approach to Brexit (not for the first time in the last three years). While Michael Gove yesterday said it was the government\u2019s assumption there would be a no-deal Brexit, Boris Johnson has sown confusion. Johnson today said that a deal with the EU is on the cards. Asked about Gove\u2019s assumption, and whether he agreed, Johnson replied: No, absolutely not. My assumption is that we can get a new deal, we\u2019re aiming for a new deal. But, of course, Michael is absolutely right that it\u2019s responsible for any government to prepare for a no deal if we absolutely have to. He also doubled down on a claim that the odds of a no-deal Brexit were a million to one. For context, the BNP Paribas report cited earlier puts the odds of no deal at 40%, or 1.5 to one. In part thanks to the pound, but also thanks to two multibillion-pound mergers, the FTSE 100 has raced ahead of other European stock market indices to a gain of more than 2%. Shares in Just Eat and the London Stock Exchange Group have gained 24% and 15% respectively. And the pain for investors in Neil Woodford\u2019s funds has continued, with an extension of withdrawal freeze until December trapping the money of hundreds of thousands of investors. Thanks for following the business live blog today. Please do join us again tomorrow for more coverage of business, economics (including the Bank of Japan\u2019s latest interest rate announcement) and markets. JJ Some extracts from the letter sent by the Woodford Equity Income Fund\u2019s authorised corporate director, Link Fund Solutions: We anticipate that the suspension of dealing is likely to last until early December while we implement the strategy to re-position the portfolio in order for the Fund to be re-opened at that time, and which is conditional upon achieving the target fund profile. In our view, this is a realistic amount of time for Woodford to complete a measured and orderly re-positioning of the Fund\u2019s portfolio of assets ensuring that there is adequate liquidity whilst preserving or realising the value of the assets. We have concluded that this approach would represent the best outcome in terms of value, time and equal treatment for all investors. Importantly, it would allow all investors to choose, whether they wish to remain invested in or to withdraw their investments from the Fund. The work that is underway to re-position the portfolio is designed to ensure that there are liquid assets available for these purposes, while continuing with the objectives and investment strategy of the Fund. [...] Progress has been made with Woodford continuing to assess the portfolio and make sales where reasonable prices can be achieved. Investors in Neil Woodford\u2019s flagship fund will be unable to get their money back until early December, administrator Link Fund Solutions has said. The Woodford Equity Income Fund suspended withdrawals from the fund on 3 June, and extended that suspension on 1 July. Link said the suspension will give a \u201crealistic\u201d amount of time to reposition the fund\u2019s portfolio, according to Reuters. That will likely involve selling many of its more illiquid stakes in companies to free up cash to pay back to investor clients. Where does this all leave the Bank of England, due to publish its latest inflation report and monetary policy on Thursday? With the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve planning interest rate cuts to stimulate their slowing economies, the Bank is expected to hold its policy steady. Yet its assumption of a smooth Brexit outcome will sound increasingly untenable if the government insists it will leave the EU without a deal. The BoE\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) is \u201cstuck between a rock and a hard place\u201d, says Paul Hollingsworth, chief UK economist at investment bank BNP Paribas. Given the risks from Brexit and global trade tensions, we do envisage the MPC striking a cautious tone. But with inflationary pressures rising, rates already well below neutral, the pound still weak and fiscal stimulus looming, easing does not look justified. In any case, it would do little to offset the heightened uncertainty. Hitting holidaymakers in the pocket as they head abroad during the school holidays, the pound has sunk by more than 10 cents against the dollar from a peak in excess of $1.33 in March. Against the euro it has fallen by more than 7 cents from a high of \u20ac1.17 recorded in May. You can read the full story by the Guardian\u2019s Richard Partington here: Don\u2019t forget that the pound\u2019s weakness comes with the US Federal Reserve set to cut interest rates on Wednesday \u2013 usually a spur for the dollar to weaken. The market-implied probability of a rate cut is 100%, with the consensus pointing to a 0.25 percentage point cut in the Fed\u2019s target range for the federal funds rate \u2013 the first in the decade since the financial crisis. That would certainly please US President Donald Trump, who has been pushing for an interest rate cut to boost the economy even as the central bank has raised rates. Under any previous president in recent years an overt intervention criticising the Fed would have been astonishing: now it is a commonplace Twitter outburst. Here are two more salvos from this morning: Wall Street has weakened slightly as markets open in New York. The S&amp;P 500 has lost less than 0.1% in early trades, the Nasdaq has lost 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average is basically flat. The demand for British government debt has risen as no-deal Brexit fears have taken centre stage. The yield on the UK 10-year gilt, the benchmark rate for government borrowing, hit 0.628% on Monday afternoon, the lowest since September 2016. Yields move inversely to prices, implying that investors are buying more of the government bonds \u2013 likely in anticipation of a round of economic stimulus from the Bank of England in the event of no-deal Brexit. When interest rates rise the demand for debt tends to fall. Some investors may (bravely) also see British government debt as a relative safe haven. Boris Johnson is speaking (on a trip to Scotland), and his words appear to be putting even more pressure on the pound: it has taken another leg lower. The new low point against the US dollar is $1.2239, a 1.1% drop. That is equal to the nadir reached on 16 March 2017. Johnson\u2019s ascent to prime minister has already prompted a severe weakening in sterling, as he has set course for a no-deal Brexit. Today he repeated that the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal on 31 October, and said that the EU would have to compromise on the backstop, an insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Today\u2019s losses for the pound would represent the biggest one-day loss since March this year. The field of European candidates to lead the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has narrowed to three, the Financial Times (\u00a3) reports. Traditionally (and for no obvious reason, given the \u201cI\u201d in IMF) the top job at the IMF has gone to a European. The process is set to run until October. Reportedly in the running are former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, World Bank boss Kristalina Georgieva and Finnish central bank boss Olli Rehn. Another big deal on a day of mega-mergers: US drug company Pfizer is buying Mylan in an all-stock deal and combining the $10bn generic pharmaceutical company with its own off-patent branded and generic business. The Pfizer business, called Upjohn, makes well known drugs such as Lipitor, Celebrex and Viagra, whose patents recently expired. Mylan, based just outside of Pittsburgh, is best known for its EpiPen, an injector used to halt life-threatening allergic reactions. Pfizer shareholders will own 57% of the combined new company and Mylan shareholders will own 43% after the all-share merger. The new company is expected to have revenues of $19-$20bn in 2020. The pound has fallen further as American traders get to their desks: it has now hit a low of $1.2282 against the US dollar, a decline of 0.8% over the course of the day. That is the first time that the pound has fallen below $1.23 since mid-March 2017. The mid-cap FTSE 250 has followed the lead set by its weightier counterpart in rising by 0.4% \u2013 despite two big dents. The pain for Sports Direct has lessened somewhat, with shares now down by 9% following its announcement late on Friday evening. However, corporate services company Sanne Group is the biggest faller, with shares down by an eye-watering 33%. Sanne cut its profit forecasts and analysts at RBC cut their target price for the stock. Here\u2019s Sanne\u2019s share price performance over the past year: The pound just came within a whisker of that $1.23 mark \u2013 it traded at $1.2301 against the US dollar, a loss of about 0.6% over the day. Sterling is down by 0.5% against the euro. The FTSE 100 is now up by 1.5% for the day. It\u2019s a somewhat more mixed picture across the rest of Europe. Germany\u2019s Dax is flat, while France\u2019s Cac 40 has lost 0.1%. Digital bank Revolut has poached the finance director of Metro Bank, it announced on Monday. David MacLean stepped down from the high street lender to join the London-based fintech firm. Metro and Revolut both sell themselves as upending the traditional banking model, but the latter is among the new crop of app-based banks who eschew branch banking. Metro has followed a \u201cbricks and clicks\u201d model that uses prominent branches. Both banks have suffered blows to their reputations in recent months. While MacLean was at Metro it mischaracterised loans, a major accounting error which was only noticed by the Bank of England. Revolut, meanwhile, has faced serious questions over its compliance processes and work culture. The FTSE 100 has gained almost 100 points, or 1.3%, to reach 7,640 points. The index has been buoyed by the London Stock Exchange Group, up 14%, and Just Eat, flying along at a 30% gain. The latter\u2019s increase is particularly notable. A Just Eat share will set you back \u00a38.24 at the time of writing, compared to an implied offer price of \u00a37.31 per share in this morning\u2019s announcement. The offer represents a premium of only 15% over Just Eat\u2019s share price on Friday, so the scale of the move suggests that investors may be eyeing a possible counter offer. Analysts at Peel Hunt this morning doggedly stuck to their target price of \u00a35.20 and a \u201csell\u201d rating on the stock \u2013 \u201cnothing changes just yet\u201d because Just Eat still faces the same tough competition and there will be little chance of cutting costs because of its different footprint to Takeaway.com. Just Eat was a pure-play, high margin takeaway platform, focusing on restaurants that do their own delivery, but it is now investing in its own delivery as competition takes its toll. Uber will dominate the smartphone real estate, as its Taxi app will accelerate the distribution of its Eats app. It can also take advantage of a fast-growing, captive audience inside the taxis themselves by making timely suggestions. Moreover, as Uber opens its platforms to restaurants that do their own delivery, its margins will improve, while Just Eat\u2019s diminish as it does the opposite. But Jocelyn Paulley, a partner at law firm Gowling WLG, said that the deal will allow cross-border scale in a business that can vary significantly from country to country. She said: Whilst technology can cross borders, other issues which are specific to each country such as taxes, traffic, urban settlement patterns and customer expectations would explain why an international tie-up is preferable compared to pushing into a new market and having to redesign systems to cope with local variations. A big media job move today: the boss of the company that owns the Mirror, Express and Star newspapers will step down to be replaced by a former betting executive. Simon Fox, the chief executive of Reach (formerly Trinity Mirror), will be replaced by the former Ladbrokes Coral boss Jim Mullen, writes the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney. Under Fox, Reach\u2019s share price has almost tripled as the business has made a series of acquisitions to build scale as the newspaper market has struggled from declining sales of printed copies and the shift of digital advertising spend to Silicon Valley giants Google and Facebook.

The board of the Woodford Patient Capital Trust today said it will assess other options for the fund. While it bears his name, legally it is a separate company from Woodford Investment Management, so the board has the ability to kick him out. It all follows the suspension of client money redemptions from his separate Equity Income Fund last month after a string of investments went sour. An announcement is due later today on whether the fund will remain suspended. Neil Woodford himself sold shares in the Patient Capital Trust between 3-8 July, according to a separate regulatory filing. The investor sold the shares, which Reuters reports would have netted him just under \u00a31m, to cover a tax bill, according to the statement. The number of Boeing 737 Max planes available to Ryanair next summer could fall to zero unless the planemaker \u201cgets its shit together\u201d, Michael O\u2019Leary said, according to Reuters. The Ryanair boss has never been one to hold back, and says that Airbus \u2013 Boeing\u2019s major rival \u2013 has cut prices. \u201cThe world has moved in their favour,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. O\u2019Leary also said that he expects more airlines to fail this winter. He predicted the same thing last year as well. Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has warned that the airline will not rule out making job cuts if the return to service of the Boeing 737 Max plane is delayed further. The Irish budget airline reported a 21% drop in quarterly profit on Monday as price wars in several European markets drove ticket prices lower, but it stuck to its annual profit target as passengers continued to spend on onboard extras, Reuters reported. However, O\u2019Leary said that Boeing has pushed back the date at which it will carry out software upgrades to the grounded 737 Max fleet from September to October. The planes have been banned from flying across the world after two fatal crashes. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, a spreadbetting firm, said: It is effectively a worst-case-scenario end to July for the pound, one that sets up three months of intense Brexit anxiety heading into All Hallows\u2019 Eve. The decline in sterling came against the dollar, even as the US Federal Reserve prepares for an interest rate cut, usually a \u201cheadache\u201d for owners of the greenback that would drive down its value. Will we see the pound below $1.23 today? The day\u2019s low point is now $1.2318 against the US dollar. Analysis by US investment bank J.P. Morgan suggests it could get worse for the pound before it gets better. Dialogue with the EU is ongoing but is likely to prove fruitless, and may segue into a general election and subsequent extension of Article 50 later this year. In the interim, the expectation is for him to push toward a \u201cno deal\u201d outcome as negotiations make little progress. At the same time, there is a \u201cdeteriorating macro landscape\u201d \u2013 the economy may even have contracted in the second quarter. And the UK is highly dependent on fickle foreign investors. Layering Brexit concerns with downward momentum in the local economy and a concerning balance of payments setup should therefore allow GBP shorts to extend yet further. The Bank of England also published its latest mortgage data on Monday, showing that banks approved lending for 66,400 house purchases in June \u2013 800 more than the previous month and slightly more than economists had expected. Net mortgage borrowing for the month by households was \u00a33.7bn, close to the average of the previous three years, the Bank said. This followed a slightly weaker net flow of \u00a32.9bn in May. British consumer borrowing growth slowed in June to a five-year low, according to new Bank of England figures published on Monday. Consumer credit, which includes borrowing such as credit cards and unsecured loans but excludes mortgages, grew at an annual rate of 5.5% year-on-year, the lowest level of growth since April 2014. Consumer credit growth has fallen steadily since its late 2016 peak. While many economists believe that credit growth has been unsustainable for years \u2013 meaning a slowdown is in some ways welcome \u2013 its link to households\u2019 willingness to spend also means that it can act as a bellwether for broader economic weakness. The dealmaking and the weak pound (which boosts multinationals\u2019 foreign currency earnings) have helped the FTSE 100 to a flying start to the week. London\u2019s benchmark index is now up by 1% at 7,628 points, after shortly after hitting its highest point since August 2018. On currency markets your new low point for the pound against the US dollar is $1.2324. An earlier post has been corrected. Please refresh to see the updated version. Takeaway.com\u2019s swoop for Just Eat may not be a done deal, however. \u201cIt is a possibility that Delivery Hero could table a rival bid,\u201d say analysts at Canaccord Genuity. Sky News previously reported that South African internet and media company Naspers was also interested in a deal, after a round of consolidation in the sector. You can read the full report on the deal here: The Just Eat/Takeaway.com deal \u201cmakes sense in the long term,\u201d said analysts at Barclays. Just Eat chief executive Peter Duffy* is understood to be on his way out of the company, which will instead be led by Takeaway.com\u2019s boss Jitse Groen. Barclays said: Just Eat shareholders would be getting the best operator in the space to run the business \u2013 a notable shift from missed execution from management in the last few years. We are believers in the value of being a global player increasing in time, with more cash flow to fight off rising competition and tech platform synergies getting more and more relevant. This is a unique opportunity to build scale and that should benefit both parties in the long term. *This post has been corrected to clarify that Peter Duffy is the chief executive of Just Eat, not Peter Plumb, who he replaced. Some important details on the Just Eat deal: the new company will be headquartered in Amsterdam (the home of Takeaway.com). However, it will still be listed on the London Stock Exchange, where Just Eat is currently a member of the FTSE 100, with a \u201csignificant part of its operations\u201d in the UK. Analysts appear to have welcomed the deal. Here\u2019s the view of Russell Pointon, of Edison Investment Research: The key feature of the combination of Just Eat and Takeaway.com is the limited geographic overlap between the companies. Therefore there will be limited consolidation of market shares in their combined markets. The companies would share best practice and know how etc. to help improve profitability to invest further behind their less profitable markets and fund the fights for market share in what is likely to be a very competitive market. He also points out an interesting contrast between the companies: Just Eat had annual revenues three times higher than Takeaway.com, yet still traded at a discount to its Dutch rival. The sell-off in sterling is gathering pace: the pound has now lost 0.34% against the US dollar and 0.3% against the euro. It\u2019s now a new low of $1.2330 for the pound against the dollar. That is now the lowest since 16 March 2017 \u2013 before new Conservative backbencher Theresa May triggered Article 50 and her disastrous decision to call a general election. Newly installed foreign secretary Dominic Raab does not appear to have offered traders much succour this morning: he had more fighting talk this morning on the BBC\u2019s Today programme. He warned the EU that it needed to change its \u201cstubborn\u201d Brexit position to avoid a no-deal Brexit, Reuters reported. \u201cWe want a good deal with our EU partners,\u201d Raab said, adding that there had been a \u201cseries of fairly stubborn positions staked out by the EU.\u201d Remember the \u201cmagic money tree\u201d? The Conservative party appears to have found it, if the rash of spending promises of new Prime Minister Boris Johnson are anything to go by. Johnson appears to be doing two things with his promises of billions for railways, tax cuts and \u201cleft behind\u201d towns, write the Guardian\u2019s Larry Elliott and Richard Partington: revving up the economy to gain support for his plans with a fallback that more spending could cushion the fallout of a no-deal departure. Although framed by Johnson as spending headroom at his disposal, economists say the additional firepower is something of an illusion. Thomas Pugh, of the consultancy Capital Economics, said: This isn\u2019t money sitting in a savings account waiting to be spent. It\u2019s more like borrowing from an overdraft where the limit is set at 2% of annual income. So spending it would result in a higher deficit and more borrowing. You can read the full story here: The London Stock Exchange Group has also enjoyed a strong morning on the weekend\u2019s merger talk: shares are up by 13% at the time of writing. LSE boss David Schwimmer (not that one) has been in the job for just over a year, but has clearly taken a leaf from Xavier Rolet, his predecessor, in going for big deals. As well as running the stock exchange and the FTSE Russell index group (which produces the FTSE 100 index), the LSE already has a lot of data services that fit in well with its trading technologies. Refinitiv, the data company carved out of Thomson Reuters last year, runs Eikon terminals which collect trading and financial data into one place for investors. At the other end of the scale from Sports Direct, Just Eat 22% shares have popped by 22% following the news of the proposed takeover by Dutch competitor Takeaway.com. The deal will give the new company a strong presence across the EU, and will also give it the scale to take on other well resourced rivals. The two companies do not compete directly in any of their major markets, so investors have long been pushing for a tie-up. Takeaway.com shares have risen by 3.7% to a record high after the deal. German rival Delivery Hero has gained 4.6% on the news as well. Sports Direct shares have fallen by as much as 20% after the retailer issued an extraordinary results statement on Friday that revealed massive tax bills, poor trading and a retail industry warning. The results were delayed throughout the day on Friday, so this morning was the first chance investors had to react. They have not welcomed the news. Here is your guide to what is going wrong at the retailer. Warning: there\u2019s a lot. The FTSE 100 has gained 0.1% at the open, but European markets are struggling a bit more. The Euro Stoxx 600 index is down by 0.2%, led by the 0.2% declines on Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Boris Johnson may have achieved his ambition of getting into 10 Downing Street last week, but financial markets have served an early reminder at the start of his first full week in office that he has a daunting task ahead of him. Sterling this morning hit a new two-year low against the US dollar, with one pound buying only $1.2358 in early trading following a weekend of no-deal Brexit tough talking from newly installed ministers. The pound weakened by 0.12% against the dollar and 0.1% against the euro. Ministers are \u201cturbo-charging\u201d preparations to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October according to several senior cabinet ministers, reports the Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason. Johnson\u2019s new cabinet Brexit fixer, Michael Gove, warned that the government was \u201coperating on the assumption\u201d that Britain would leave without a deal on 31 October and it was a \u201cvery real prospect\u201d. The stakes are clear for businesses in Britain. Carlos Tavares, the boss of PSA Group, used an interview last night with the Financial Times to warn that he could close the company\u2019s factory in Ellesmere Port, which manufactures Vauxhall Astra cars, if there is a no-deal Brexit that disrupts exports from the factory. The jobs of 1,000 workers hang in the balance. It seems unlikely that the EU will be willing to make material changes to the existing deal, according to Fernando Barajas, an analyst at Creditsights, a debt rating agency. \u201cThere is little sign\u201d that the no-deal threats have made an impact on the EU\u2019s stance. A general election in the near term now seems a high likelihood outcome. Yet all of the political noise has not put off the dealmakers in London. Over the weekend two large mergers have come through. The FTSE 100\u2019s Just Eat and Dutch Takeaway.com have agreed a \u00a38.2bn all-share deal to create one of the world\u2019s biggest takeaway delivery players. Just Eat faces renewed competition from Amazon-backed Deliveroo and Uber Eats, and some activist investors have been pushing for a deal for some time. Another big deal on the cards is the London Stock Exchange Group\u2019s merger with data company Refinitiv, a potential $27bn deal. A formal announcement of the terms could come this week when the LSE publishes results. Asian markets were mixed on Monday, with shares in Japan weakening, while Australia\u2019s benchmark ASX 200 rose by 0.95%. However, many investors will have their eyes on events later in the week, when the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in a decade. Trade talks to fix the relationship between the US and China, one of the biggest factors in the Fed\u2019s desire to support the economy, will resume tomorrow, although few are holding out hope of a positive development. The agenda 9:30am BST: Bank of England consumer credit (June) 9:30am BST: Bank of England mortgage approvals (June) 3:30pm BST: US Dallas Fed manufacturing index (July)",

Their parties, including Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), struggled to win more than 10% of the national vote for decades until the 1990s, when they started to expand on the back of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/ayodhya-mosque-india-guardian-report\">national campaign to demolish a 16th-century Mughal mosque</a> and replace it with a Hindu temple.</p>\n    <p>BJP\u2019s support was limited to wealthier Hindus in the country\u2019s north and west, with resistance to the party from poor, marginalised Hindus, Muslims and south Indians thought to be permanent hurdles to Hindu nationalist domination.</p>\n    <p>Modi\u2019s magnetism, especially his personal branding as a tea boy who climbed to the country\u2019s highest ranks, has changed those calculations, drawing vast support from the country\u2019s emerging middle and lower-middle classes.

In Modi they had a leader who spoke as if it already was.</p>\n    <p>Alongside aspiration, the BJP promotes a vision of Hindu cultural supremacy that sidelines the country\u2019s 300m minority population. As chief minister of Gujarat state, Modi was a firebrand Hindutva campaigner. In 2002, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre\">anti-Muslim riots in his state killed at least 1,000 people</a>, resulting in the future prime minister becoming an international pariah who was banned from entering the US.</p>\n    <p>In response, Modi presented himself as an outsider being attacked by elites: a refrain that would become a central part of his political messaging, that he was constantly being targeted by the English-speaking media out of Delhi.</p>\n    <p>When popular disgust at corruption scandals plaguing the previous Congress government boiled over into street protests in 2011, it provided the rightwing populist leader a national springboard.

In one scene, Modi holds an improvised spear and tells Grylls: \u201cI\u2019ll hold this for you.\u201d The programme is the latest of Modi\u2019s choreographed media appearances where the strongman leader casts himself as the a symbol of masculinity, strength and robust health \u2013 a pitch that appeals to his party\u2019s nationalist voter base. \u201cHe is the alpha-male. He will not lose even a single opportunity to project himself as the man with the 56-inch chest,\u201d said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of a biography on Modi, referring to a claim Modi made on his campaign trail in 2014. In recent months, Modi has bolstered that superhuman image \u2013 appearing in images that show him meditating in a Himalayan cave and doing early morning yoga exercises. \u201cHe wants to be seen as the biggest and most popular globally-accepted political leader from India ever. He wants to have iconic status globally.\u201d Promoting the trailer for the programme, Modi tweeted: \u201cIndia \u2013 where you find lush green forests, diverse wildlife, beautiful mountains and mighty rivers. Watching this programme will make you want to visit different parts of India and add to discourse of environmental conservation.\u201d The programme previously caused controversy in India after the Indian Express reported that Modi was likely to have been filming with Bear Grylls on the day of a terror attack in the disputed region of Kashmir, when extremists from neighbouring Pakistan killed dozens of Indian armed security personnel and almost prompted military conflict. Some reports suggest Modi delayed taking action after the attack because he was in the wilderness filming with Grylls, but this has not been confirmed. \u201cWe know how important it was to him to feature in this show,\u201d Mukhopadhyay said. The appearance with Bear Grylls will also bolster Modi\u2019s image as a protector of India\u2019s environment. Bhavreen Kandhari, an Extinction Rebellion activist in India, said Modi\u2019s pro-business, pro-development government contributes to India\u2019s environmental destruction. She ridiculed the UN\u2019s decision to award Modi the title of Champion of the Earth in 2018. \u201cI am standing in the most polluted city in the world,\u201d she said, speaking over the phone from New Delhi. \u201cMy children\u2019s lungs are black. There is no day when I don\u2019t get calls about trees being cut down. There is absolute devastation.\u201d Modi\u2019s government has made international commitments to increasing India\u2019s solar power production, but has also given the green light to controversial mining and infrastructure projects that will result in deforestation and environmental issues. In June, images from a giant landfill site went viral after it was reported that a mountain of garbage was set to climb higher than the Taj Mahal. On Monday, as he announced the results of a tiger census, which showed the number of Bengal tigers in the wild had risen, Modi said: \u201cI feel it is possible to strike a healthy balance between development and environment. Our country is one where for thousands of years there have been teachings of co-existence [with nature].\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Social services at the Tory-run Northamptonshire county council are failing to keep children safe, according to an Ofsted report that identifies weaknesses across a range of services that support vulnerable young people. The report is the latest blow for the council, which declared effective bankruptcy last year and has spent the 18 months since then coming to terms with half a decade of chronic mismanagement and spending cuts.

I hope it\u2019s going to be a vintage year. But still: it isn\u2019t as long as <em>our</em> longlist.</p> <p>This year, a mighty 174 books have been nominated for the Not the Booker prize. That\u2019s an impressive indication of the scale of publishing in English-language fiction and of the enthusiasm you guys have for reading. But now, it\u2019s time to start talking about how good some of these books are. To do that, we need to produce our shortlist.</p> <p>The first part of that process is to whittle down 174 books to a far more manageable three, which we will then add to three more \u2013 one selected by last year\u2019s judges and one from each of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jul/22/not-the-booker-prize-2019-nominate-your-novel-of-the-year-now\">our two nominated book champions for this year</a>, <a href=\"https://www.storyhouse.com/venue/storyhouse/library\">Storyhouse library in Chester</a> and <a href=\"https://goldenharebooks.com/\">Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh.</a></p> <p>And when I say \u201cwe\u201d, I really mean \u201cyou\u201d.

It would also be very helpful if you could <strong>include the word \u201cvote\u201d.</strong></p> <p>We\u2019re hoping for a minimum of 100 words in the review. We won\u2019t be counting all that carefully, as there are only so many hours in the day \u2013 but at the very least make it look like you care and please give us your honest feelings.</p> <p>That\u2019s it. As I say, it should be easy, but every year a few people get confused and we\u2019re unable to count their votes. So please check your entry carefully to be certain that your voice is heard.</p> <p>You\u2019ve got just over one week. The next deadline is <strong>23.59 BST on Monday 5 August 2019</strong>. Please make sure you nominate your favourite books before then \u2013 and feel free to tell all your friends to take part too. I\u2019ll be back here on 6 August to post the results.</p> <p>As is traditional, before we get to the list, I have to thank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/tips-links-and-suggestions-books\">Tips, links and suggestions</a> stalwart and all-round superstar Lisa Jones for her help in checking eligibility and titles.

      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s Booker longlist has been described as \u201can absolute gift for bookselling\u201d and seems popular with critics and the book-buying public alike, which is excellent. I hope it\u2019s going to be a vintage year. But still: it isn\u2019t as long as our longlist. This year, a mighty 174 books have been nominated for the Not the Booker prize. That\u2019s an impressive indication of the scale of publishing in English-language fiction and of the enthusiasm you guys have for reading. But now, it\u2019s time to start talking about how good some of these books are. To do that, we need to produce our shortlist. The first part of that process is to whittle down 174 books to a far more manageable three, which we will then add to three more \u2013 one selected by last year\u2019s judges and one from each of our two nominated book champions for this year, Storyhouse library in Chester and Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh. And when I say \u201cwe\u201d, I really mean \u201cyou\u201d. This is part of the competition that you control, because it\u2019s your vote that will help decide which three books go forward into the next round. Voting is easy \u2013 or it will be if you read the following instructions carefully: In order for your vote to be counted and comply with our all killer, no filler terms and conditions, you need to choose two books from the longlist below, from two different publishers, and accompany those choices with a short review of at least one of your chosen books. It would also be very helpful if you could include the word \u201cvote\u201d. We\u2019re hoping for a minimum of 100 words in the review. We won\u2019t be counting all that carefully, as there are only so many hours in the day \u2013 but at the very least make it look like you care and please give us your honest feelings. That\u2019s it. As I say, it should be easy, but every year a few people get confused and we\u2019re unable to count their votes. So please check your entry carefully to be certain that your voice is heard. You\u2019ve got just over one week. The next deadline is 23.59 BST on Monday 5 August 2019. Please make sure you nominate your favourite books before then \u2013 and feel free to tell all your friends to take part too. I\u2019ll be back here on 6 August to post the results. As is traditional, before we get to the list, I have to thank Tips, links and suggestions stalwart and all-round superstar Lisa Jones for her help in checking eligibility and titles. And as is usual, when you see the size of the list, you\u2019ll understand why I\u2019m so grateful for her spreadsheet skillz.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson is refusing to sit down for talks with EU leaders until they agree to ditch the Irish backstop from the Brexit withdrawal agreement, despite invitations to meetings from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron.</p> \n<p>His official spokeswoman said the prime minister had made clear that he wanted to strike a deal, but that there was no point in holding face-to-face talks unless the EU agreed to reopen the agreement.</p> \n<p>But on a visit to the Trident nuclear base at Faslane in Scotland on Monday, Johnson painted a more optimistic picture of the prospects for talks, telling reporters there was \u201cample scope\u201d to achieve a new deal.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe are not aiming for a no-deal Brexit at all. What we want is to get a deal and I\u2019ve had some interesting conversations with our European partners. I\u2019ve talked to [the European commission president] Jean-Claude [Juncker] and Angela Merkel and we\u2019re reaching out today to [the Irish prime minister] Leo Varadkar. The feeling is, yes there\u2019s no change in their position, but it\u2019s very, very positive.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he added: \u201cThey all know where we are: we can\u2019t accept the backstop, it was thrown out three times, the withdrawal agreement as it stands is dead and everybody gets that. But there is ample scope to do a new deal and a better deal.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"08b8960f-4556-460f-aa40-601083c90627\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is the original \u2018backstop\u2019 in the withdrawal agreement?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device in the withdrawal agreement intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.</p>\n    <p>It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was added to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Joint interpretative instrument&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n    <p>A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/12/brexit-mps-vote-theresa-may-backstop-deal-jeremy-corbyn-politics-live?page=with:block-5c8793aee4b016d23425a23e#block-5c8793aee4b016d23425a23e\">it failed to persuade the attorney general</a>, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it \u2018reduces the risk\u2019 of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/hunt-and-johnson-the-backstop-is-dead-and-cant-be-in-any-eu-deal\">declared the Northern Ireland backstop \u2018dead\u2019</a> during his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he renegotiated with the EU.

And that is the message that he has been giving to leaders when he has spoken to them on the telephone so far.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe EU has said up to now it is not willing to renegotiate [the backstop] \u2026 The prime minister would be happy to sit down with leaders when that position changes. But he is making it clear to everybody he speaks to that that needs to happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about his plans to kickstart negotiations with the EU over the summer, after the foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/eu-officials-reject-dominic-raabs-easier-no-deal-brexit-claim\">Dominic Raab, appeared to suggest</a> on Monday morning that he would not reopen talks until the EU agreed to ditch the backstop, Johnson said: \u201cI believe in reaching out. I\u2019ve already been talking to colleagues around the table in Brussels, I have absolutely no inhibitions about that. We are going to engage and obviously ask for very profound changes to the current basis for leaving the EU.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the formal position of the EU that there could be no further negotiations on the withdrawal agreement remained unchanged, he said, \u201cthey understand that the UK and the EU are two great political entities and it is possible for us to come up with a new deal that will be to the benefit of both sides\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/boris-johnson-vote-leave-eu-exit\">The Vote Leave gang now running Britain do not want to govern. They want to win | Matthew d\u2019Ancona</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Despite the positivity of Johnson\u2019s outlook in Faslane, where he met naval personnel working inside the nuclear submarine HMS Victorious, his underlying position on talks makes clear that No 10 is proceeding towards a no-deal Brexit unless EU leaders change their minds about not reopening the withdrawal agreement. It is counter to expectations among some of Johnson\u2019s supporters that he would embark on a whistle-stop diplomatic tour of European capitals to propose an alternative to the backstop, instead leaving the ball in the court of EU leaders to make a move.</p> \n<p>The No 10 spokeswoman said: \u201cI think he has been clear that the backstop has to be abolished. He remains confident that the EU will stop claiming that the withdrawal agreement cannot be changed. But until that happens we must assume that there will be a no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> on 31 October.\u201d</p> \n<p>Responding to Johnson\u2019s refusal to meet EU leaders without a promise to scrap the backstop, one EU source said: \u201cThis choice puts us on the path towards no deal, which is the worst possible way to manage the consequences of Brexit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Others detected nothing new in Johnson\u2019s bravado. \u201cAs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/19/mandy-rice-davies\">Mandy Rice-Davies</a> once said in a court case in the 1960s, \u2018he would say that, wouldn\u2019t he\u2019,\u201d an EU diplomat said. \u201cThe demand for a new withdrawal agreement is simply not realistic, it is not in this world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some wondered whether the British government should be taken seriously. \u201cI am not sure what he is playing at,\u201d one diplomat said. \u201cIt takes you two minutes to realise the backstop is important to the EU, you don\u2019t need to be a big Brexit expert. Either you are not talking, or this is for another audience, and I hope it is the latter.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU leaders should seek to meet the new incumbent at No 10, the diplomat suggested, \u201cto filter out what he means and what he is saying to a domestic audience\u201d.</p> \n<p>A European commission spokesperson referred to a phone call between Juncker and Johnson last week, when the outgoing commission president outlined that the bloc would not change the Brexit agreement finalised with Theresa May, but remained open to changing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/22/the-brexit-political-declaration-rated\">political declaration</a> text.</p> \n<p>The spokesperson said: \u201cWe have agreed a withdrawal agreement with the United Kingdom government. The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible. We are willing to add language to the political declaration, but we will not reopen the withdrawal agreement.\u201d </p> \n<p>Earlier, Raab refused to say whether Johnson was planning to see EU leaders any time soon, saying there would be meetings \u201cin due course\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccd4c944021b85c31486199bc6c8ff478d04cf79\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccd4c944021b85c31486199bc6c8ff478d04cf79/0_30_4360_2617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Raab arrives to attend a cabinet meeting on Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson is ramping up planning for no deal with a series of new cabinet committees to prepare for leaving on 31 October.</p> \n<p>The government is also planning an advertising campaign involving spending up to \u00a3100m on warning the public and business to get ready. Johnson\u2019s spokeswoman could not say what the exact messages would be or whether the public would be advised to stockpile. It will not involve leafleting every household, but broadcast and billboard advertisements are likely.</p> \n<p>David Frost, Johnson\u2019s new chief Brexit negotiator, has warned his European counterparts not to underestimate the prime minister. According to a leaked email seen by the Financial Times, Frost sent an email telling them that \u201cyou should be in no doubt about this government\u2019s commitment to the 31 October date\u201d.</p> \n<p>It added: \u201cI would also add that many people are inclined to underestimate Boris Johnson and I would urge you not to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, unlike the prime minister, Frost has been seeking to meet MEPs, requesting meetings this week with the European parliament\u2019s pointman on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt. The Belgian MEP and senior parliament officials were not available to see Frost because they were not in Brussels. </p> \n<p>On his visit to Scotland, Johnson heaped praise on the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, who on Sunday issued a defiant challenge to the prime minister, pledging that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/28/support-no-deal-brexit-scottish-ruth-davidson-boris-johnson\">she will refuse to back a no-deal Brexit</a>.</p> \n<p>Claiming that he was \u201cwith Ruth in wanting to avoid a no-deal Brexit\u201d, he said: \u201cRuth has been a fantastic leader of the Scottish Conservatives. I am lost in admiration for what she has achieved. I\u2019m a massive fan of the way she has taken the argument to those who would destroy our union.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davidson has made no secret of her reservations about the new prime minister, and Johnson infuriated her last week by sacking her ally David Mundell as Scottish secretary against her advice.</p> \n<p>The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she intended to set out for Johnson the \u201cconsiderable damage\u201d that any Brexit, and especially a no-deal Brexit, would do to Scotland\u2019s economy.</p> \n<p>Speaking in advance of her first face-to-face meeting with Johnson since he became prime minister, she said: \u201cBoris Johnson has formed a hardline Tory government with one aim: to take Scotland and the UK out of the EU without a deal.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is refusing to sit down for talks with EU leaders until they agree to ditch the Irish backstop from the Brexit withdrawal agreement, despite invitations to meetings from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. His official spokeswoman said the prime minister had made clear that he wanted to strike a deal, but that there was no point in holding face-to-face talks unless the EU agreed to reopen the agreement. But on a visit to the Trident nuclear base at Faslane in Scotland on Monday, Johnson painted a more optimistic picture of the prospects for talks, telling reporters there was \u201cample scope\u201d to achieve a new deal. He said: \u201cWe are not aiming for a no-deal Brexit at all. What we want is to get a deal and I\u2019ve had some interesting conversations with our European partners. I\u2019ve talked to [the European commission president] Jean-Claude [Juncker] and Angela Merkel and we\u2019re reaching out today to [the Irish prime minister] Leo Varadkar. The feeling is, yes there\u2019s no change in their position, but it\u2019s very, very positive.\u201d But he added: \u201cThey all know where we are: we can\u2019t accept the backstop, it was thrown out three times, the withdrawal agreement as it stands is dead and everybody gets that. But there is ample scope to do a new deal and a better deal.\u201d While Johnson has spoken to Merkel and Macron, there are no plans to accept their invitations to visit without a change in their position on the backstop. Irish officials are understood to view the delay in contacting Varadkar as indicative of an unwillingness to enter serious talks. Varadkar is adamant that the backstop must stay to prevent a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland and preserve the integrity of the single market. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: \u201cThe PM has been clear that he wants to meet EU leaders and negotiate, but not to sit down and be told that the EU cannot possibly reopen the withdrawal agreement. And that is the message that he has been giving to leaders when he has spoken to them on the telephone so far. \u201cThe EU has said up to now it is not willing to renegotiate [the backstop] \u2026 The prime minister would be happy to sit down with leaders when that position changes. But he is making it clear to everybody he speaks to that that needs to happen.\u201d Asked about his plans to kickstart negotiations with the EU over the summer, after the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, appeared to suggest on Monday morning that he would not reopen talks until the EU agreed to ditch the backstop, Johnson said: \u201cI believe in reaching out. I\u2019ve already been talking to colleagues around the table in Brussels, I have absolutely no inhibitions about that. We are going to engage and obviously ask for very profound changes to the current basis for leaving the EU.\u201d Although the formal position of the EU that there could be no further negotiations on the withdrawal agreement remained unchanged, he said, \u201cthey understand that the UK and the EU are two great political entities and it is possible for us to come up with a new deal that will be to the benefit of both sides\u201d. Despite the positivity of Johnson\u2019s outlook in Faslane, where he met naval personnel working inside the nuclear submarine HMS Victorious, his underlying position on talks makes clear that No 10 is proceeding towards a no-deal Brexit unless EU leaders change their minds about not reopening the withdrawal agreement. It is counter to expectations among some of Johnson\u2019s supporters that he would embark on a whistle-stop diplomatic tour of European capitals to propose an alternative to the backstop, instead leaving the ball in the court of EU leaders to make a move. The No 10 spokeswoman said: \u201cI think he has been clear that the backstop has to be abolished. He remains confident that the EU will stop claiming that the withdrawal agreement cannot be changed. But until that happens we must assume that there will be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.\u201d Responding to Johnson\u2019s refusal to meet EU leaders without a promise to scrap the backstop, one EU source said: \u201cThis choice puts us on the path towards no deal, which is the worst possible way to manage the consequences of Brexit.\u201d Others detected nothing new in Johnson\u2019s bravado. \u201cAs Mandy Rice-Davies once said in a court case in the 1960s, \u2018he would say that, wouldn\u2019t he\u2019,\u201d an EU diplomat said. \u201cThe demand for a new withdrawal agreement is simply not realistic, it is not in this world.\u201d Some wondered whether the British government should be taken seriously. \u201cI am not sure what he is playing at,\u201d one diplomat said. \u201cIt takes you two minutes to realise the backstop is important to the EU, you don\u2019t need to be a big Brexit expert. Either you are not talking, or this is for another audience, and I hope it is the latter.\u201d EU leaders should seek to meet the new incumbent at No 10, the diplomat suggested, \u201cto filter out what he means and what he is saying to a domestic audience\u201d. A European commission spokesperson referred to a phone call between Juncker and Johnson last week, when the outgoing commission president outlined that the bloc would not change the Brexit agreement finalised with Theresa May, but remained open to changing the political declaration text. The spokesperson said: \u201cWe have agreed a withdrawal agreement with the United Kingdom government. The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible. We are willing to add language to the political declaration, but we will not reopen the withdrawal agreement.\u201d Earlier, Raab refused to say whether Johnson was planning to see EU leaders any time soon, saying there would be meetings \u201cin due course\u201d. Johnson is ramping up planning for no deal with a series of new cabinet committees to prepare for leaving on 31 October. The government is also planning an advertising campaign involving spending up to \u00a3100m on warning the public and business to get ready. Johnson\u2019s spokeswoman could not say what the exact messages would be or whether the public would be advised to stockpile. It will not involve leafleting every household, but broadcast and billboard advertisements are likely. David Frost, Johnson\u2019s new chief Brexit negotiator, has warned his European counterparts not to underestimate the prime minister. According to a leaked email seen by the Financial Times, Frost sent an email telling them that \u201cyou should be in no doubt about this government\u2019s commitment to the 31 October date\u201d. It added: \u201cI would also add that many people are inclined to underestimate Boris Johnson and I would urge you not to do so.\u201d However, unlike the prime minister, Frost has been seeking to meet MEPs, requesting meetings this week with the European parliament\u2019s pointman on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt. The Belgian MEP and senior parliament officials were not available to see Frost because they were not in Brussels. On his visit to Scotland, Johnson heaped praise on the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, who on Sunday issued a defiant challenge to the prime minister, pledging that she will refuse to back a no-deal Brexit. Claiming that he was \u201cwith Ruth in wanting to avoid a no-deal Brexit\u201d, he said: \u201cRuth has been a fantastic leader of the Scottish Conservatives. I am lost in admiration for what she has achieved. I\u2019m a massive fan of the way she has taken the argument to those who would destroy our union.\u201d Davidson has made no secret of her reservations about the new prime minister, and Johnson infuriated her last week by sacking her ally David Mundell as Scottish secretary against her advice. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she intended to set out for Johnson the \u201cconsiderable damage\u201d that any Brexit, and especially a no-deal Brexit, would do to Scotland\u2019s economy. Speaking in advance of her first face-to-face meeting with Johnson since he became prime minister, she said: \u201cBoris Johnson has formed a hardline Tory government with one aim: to take Scotland and the UK out of the EU without a deal.\u201d",

Now it\u2019s serious | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2016, the EU referendum result was seen by many as the worst UK foreign policy calamity since Suez, an egregious act of economic self-harm. It would cause irreparable damage to Britain\u2019s place in the world. Business groups went into emergency session, expressing their dismay and trying to work out what to do for their members. I was then running the UK\u2019s creative industries body, 96% of which <a href=\"https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/23-29-may-2016/creative-industries-federation-members-survey-shows-96-want-stay-eu/\" title=\"\">had backed remain</a>. What would happen to Britain\u2019s much vaunted openness? How would we continue to attract global talent?</p> <p>The questions kept coming. None of them has been answered. Yet, the worse the situation becomes, the quieter the voices.</p> <p>A few months ago, as I was contacting a number of chief executives to discuss calling for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/27/soft-brexit-dead-labour-peoples-vote-referendum-remain\" title=\"\">people\u2019s vote</a>, one replied: \u201cI don\u2019t like to get involved in things like that.\u201d This senior figure of a large, European-owned company was adamant that they \u201cdon\u2019t do politics\u201d. I scratched my head.</p> <p>Only once in a while does one hear a peep out of the trade bodies. Today, the Confederation of British Industry warned companies to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49142762\" title=\"\">step up their preparations</a> for a no-deal Brexit. It tells employers to ready themselves for mass disruption. The advice is detailed and helpful. But where is the politics? Where is the flexing of muscles? Where is the fury at what is being done to businesses, large and small? For the past three years, business has been timid, even cowardly.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons for this. First, the perpetual attacks from the populist-nationalist right and the hard left against business has taken its toll. CEOs have begun to believe the rhetoric that they only represent the \u201celite\u201d. In some cases \u2013 the banks, utilities, other FTSE companies that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/24/ballooning-executive-pay-is-at-last-coming-under-scrutiny\" title=\"\">overpay their senior executives</a> \u2013 that rings true. But the vast majority of small and medium-sized businesses are doing their best to provide jobs. Brexit catastrophically undermines that. Just ask the car companies: in the latest instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/29/brexit-could-spell-end-of-ellesmere-port-plant-says-vauxhall-owner\" title=\"\">Vauxhall</a> says 1,000 jobs are at risk after Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"623eb990b7a90b7a9ed0e1745fde8836078ebddb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/623eb990b7a90b7a9ed0e1745fde8836078ebddb/648_533_2217_1330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Kaeser, chief executive of Siemens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Kaeser, chief executive of Siemens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Second is ingratiation. I never cease to be amazed at how easy it is to buy people\u2019s compliance. Governments use a range of inducements. Chairs and chief execs love nothing more than being invited into the inner sanctum. The evening reception or business roundtable at No 10 is what they\u2019ve worked towards all their careers. They might even be asked to head a government commission. The most popular reward designed to buy silence and sycophancy is, of course, the gong.</p> <p>The most complex reason for their reticence is habituation, or as the Cambridge Dictionary describes it: \u201cThe process of people or animals becoming used to something, so that they no longer find it unpleasant or think it is a threat.\u201d It was a common behaviour trait during the dictatorships of the 20th century. It takes a number of forms. One is denial and a suspension of intellectual faculties. People convince themselves that things are really not that bad. Conjure that blitz spirit: it\u2019s hard, but we\u2019ll get through this.</p> <p>Finally comes displacement therapy. Trade bodies ululate on Twitter that a deputy minister for tiddlywinks has graced their annual reception, celebrating the fact that they have won a concession on a minor piece of policy. It\u2019s a modern-day version of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.</p> <p>In Britain and the US, what was previously regarded as extreme has become mainstream.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson, Brexit and no deal are now ingrained in the national psyche. The government is to launch a mass advertising campaign aiming to \u201cprepare\u201d us for crashing out of Europe. Blitz spirit. Tin hats. Nothing that a bit of optimism won\u2019t solve. In 2016, the EU referendum result was seen by many as the worst UK foreign policy calamity since Suez, an egregious act of economic self-harm. It would cause irreparable damage to Britain\u2019s place in the world. Business groups went into emergency session, expressing their dismay and trying to work out what to do for their members. I was then running the UK\u2019s creative industries body, 96% of which had backed remain. What would happen to Britain\u2019s much vaunted openness? How would we continue to attract global talent? The questions kept coming. None of them has been answered. Yet, the worse the situation becomes, the quieter the voices. A few months ago, as I was contacting a number of chief executives to discuss calling for a people\u2019s vote, one replied: \u201cI don\u2019t like to get involved in things like that.\u201d This senior figure of a large, European-owned company was adamant that they \u201cdon\u2019t do politics\u201d. I scratched my head. Only once in a while does one hear a peep out of the trade bodies. Today, the Confederation of British Industry warned companies to step up their preparations for a no-deal Brexit. It tells employers to ready themselves for mass disruption. The advice is detailed and helpful. But where is the politics? Where is the flexing of muscles? Where is the fury at what is being done to businesses, large and small? For the past three years, business has been timid, even cowardly. There are a number of reasons for this. First, the perpetual attacks from the populist-nationalist right and the hard left against business has taken its toll. CEOs have begun to believe the rhetoric that they only represent the \u201celite\u201d. In some cases \u2013 the banks, utilities, other FTSE companies that overpay their senior executives \u2013 that rings true. But the vast majority of small and medium-sized businesses are doing their best to provide jobs. Brexit catastrophically undermines that. Just ask the car companies: in the latest instance, Vauxhall says 1,000 jobs are at risk after Brexit. Second is ingratiation. I never cease to be amazed at how easy it is to buy people\u2019s compliance. Governments use a range of inducements. Chairs and chief execs love nothing more than being invited into the inner sanctum. The evening reception or business roundtable at No 10 is what they\u2019ve worked towards all their careers. They might even be asked to head a government commission. The most popular reward designed to buy silence and sycophancy is, of course, the gong. The most complex reason for their reticence is habituation, or as the Cambridge Dictionary describes it: \u201cThe process of people or animals becoming used to something, so that they no longer find it unpleasant or think it is a threat.\u201d It was a common behaviour trait during the dictatorships of the 20th century. It takes a number of forms. One is denial and a suspension of intellectual faculties. People convince themselves that things are really not that bad. Conjure that blitz spirit: it\u2019s hard, but we\u2019ll get through this. Finally comes displacement therapy. Trade bodies ululate on Twitter that a deputy minister for tiddlywinks has graced their annual reception, celebrating the fact that they have won a concession on a minor piece of policy. It\u2019s a modern-day version of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. In Britain and the US, what was previously regarded as extreme has become mainstream. The notion of an EU departure was, until very recently, dismissed as a fringe activity; but even after that shock, it was generally assumed a soft landing would be agreed. The idea of no deal would have been regarded as beyond comprehension. In the same vein, in the US, Donald Trump has successfully moved the boundaries of acceptability and, instead of using its muscle, business and most of public life has gone along with it. Some chief executives say, \u201cWhy alienate part of our customer base?\u201d On those terms you would never say or do anything about anything \u2013 inequality, the climate emergency \u2013 because someone out there might disagree. But speaking out against Brexit and Trump should be an exception. Perhaps the bravest CEO at the moment is Siemens\u2019 Joe Kaeser, who regularly denounces the German far-right AfD while most of his fellow industry leaders remain silent. Stay out of trouble. Don\u2019t rock the boat. Keep in with the powerful. Given the state of the world now, given the impending crisis set to befall us on 31 October, how bad do things need to be? It\u2019s time our business leaders begin to show some spine. \u2022 John Kampfner is the founder and former CEO of the Creative Industries Federation",

Let\u2019s start with a rush of enthusiasm from WildIrish, who has been reading A Terrible Country by Keith Gessen: Brilliant! Impeccable writing that is Gessen\u2019s own-tragic-lighthearted-humorous-yet-wise-beyond-his-years-voice; instantly relatable. Why have I never heard of this amazing book? This is one of those rare novels that I try to read slowly because it\u2019s so good that I wish it would never end. It still whips by at terrifying speeds and cannot be put down. This book has literally attached itself to my hand\u2026 Sadly, I am nearing the end of this truly marvellous novel. All I can say is, if you don\u2019t read A Terrible Country, you will have missed out on one of the finest books this year \u2026 I would hug this Writer. And I\u2019m NOT a touchy person at all. Tessa Hadley\u2019s Bad Dreams has had a more muted (but still significant) impact on allworthy: Tessa Hadley\u2019s short story collection Bad Dreams is quietly impressing me. Stories pack a punch and a great deal said in little space. Surprise you too. The Miniaturist by Jessie Burton has impressed Magrat123: It is a remarkably accomplished debut novel, a real tragical romance; both it and the faithful, sumptuously realised TV version had me reaching for the tissues. Burton has done a lot of research \u2013 which she details in the nowadays obligatory endnotes \u2013 but it is worn lightly and the reader is never subjected to expository lumps. Vesca recommends Hawthorn and Child by Keith Ridgway \u2013 so long as it isn\u2019t habit forming: I\u2019ve been trying to get through (and rid of) some of the unread books on my shelves lately, so started with Hawthorn and Child by Keith Ridgway, which I went into expecting a supernatural detective story, and finished with something less absurd but much more actually mad. Things connect, obliquely, nothing is really resolved, everyone\u2019s not ok, and horrible things happen. I would recommend it but I wouldn\u2019t want this to be the kind of thing I read all the time. Riddle of the Labyrinth by Margalit Fox is a book that \u201chas it all\u201d, says Carmen212: I love this book. It tickles my code nerd. It was Alice Kober who made all the breakthroughs but she died young and her work was coopted. Fascinating story: Kober was a brilliant woman and devoted decades to breaking the code. She came so close. I love the intricacies of code-breaking \u2026 Linguistics, history, cryptology - has it all! Dennis89 has just finished Tender is the Night by F Scott Fitzgerald: A rather dark and brooding semi-autobiographical novel set in the 1920\u2019s concerning the background, journey and ultimate collapse of a brittle yet somewhat essential marriage between a young psychiatrist and his wealthy though troubled wife. I particularly enjoyed the Triptych structure of the novel set in a non-chronological order \u2026 just as one part was starting to become a slight drag the next instalment injected some much needed depth and acceleration to the story. I felt the compression and elongation of timescales within the novel was a literary trick well used. An enjoyable read in a similar vein to The Great Gatsby and ideal as a sweltering summer escape! Finally \u2013 and still on the subject of the heatwave \u2013 Enrique Vila-Matas\u2019s Vampire in Love \u201cdeserves a better write up that I can manage this evening (it\u2019s hot, I\u2019m tired),\u201d says dothebathosphere: It\u2019s a collection of 19 short stories spanning Vila-Matas\u2019s career (a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d I suppose rather than thematic collection). A few are slight (just a couple of pages) but most are substantial, and two are absolutely note perfect and mini masterpieces (A Permanent Home &amp; The Boy on the Swing). Tonally it\u2019s a bit sharper than the last Vila-Matas I read (The Illogic of Kassel), in that book I was a worried that Vila-Matas was being a bit too cute but here the narrators are anything but (octogenarians waiting for their eldest offspring to die, rude and drunk house guests, down at heal and spectacularly overweight actors...), yet often times they achieve what I\u2019ll coin as a \u201ccurmudgeon sublime\u201d. Most excellent. Curmudgeon sublime! Sounds fantastic. Interesting links about books and reading Here\u2019s the winner of this year\u2019s Hemingway look-alike competition. Slate recommend 100 books for ambitious teenagers to devour this summer. Karin Slaughter killed a character with antifreeze; Peter Swanson used cashews and a missing EpiPen: inside the devious minds of thriller writers. A system for spotting fake reviews is getting bad (fake) reviews and this it kind of feels like a metaphor for everything. In the New Yorker, Jill Lepore says that Herman Melville \u201cwrote most of Moby-Dick on land, in a valley, on a farm, in a house a-dither with his wife, his sisters, and his mother.\u201d If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.

A 2017 documentary accusing the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, of corruption received more than 30m views on YouTube within two months.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>He has been repeatedly arrested and jailed. The European court of human rights ruled that Russia violated Navalny's rights by holding him under house arrest in 2014.

Navalny told the commission its decision would be a vote 'not against me, but against 16,000 people who have nominated me; against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/24/russians-navalny-opposition-putin-2018\">200,000 volunteers who have been canvassing for me</a>'.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There has also been a physical price to pay.

If unrest is growing in Russia, it may be because the economy is at a five-year standstill, living standards are falling, businesses are closing and 13% of the population lives in poverty. Last week, Russia\u2019s central bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d1d01d4-af93-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2\" title=\"\">warned that economic growth was slowing further</a>.</p> \n<p>These chronic problems have several causes. One is endemic corruption at state and local level. Another is the way the government has squandered Russia\u2019s oil and gas revenues, failing to invest in jobs, healthcare, education and infrastructure in periods when energy income was high. Lack of diversification is another structural problem boding ill for the future.</p> \n<p>Russia\u2019s political and economic woes share one factor in common: Putin, and the self-serving, unrepresentative, opaque regime he runs. He insists, for example, that US and EU sanctions imposed after his illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea are not hurting Russia. Yet analysts estimate the sanctions <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/vladislav-inozemtsev\" title=\"\">provoked massive capital flight</a>, in excess of $317bn, in ensuing years and continuing, dramatic falls in foreign direct investment.</p> \n<p>Putin\u2019s popularity, although still relatively high, is sharply down on previous levels. Signs of growing political weakness were discerned in recent decisions to bow to public pressure <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20190611-russia-journalist-police-drop-drug-charges-investigative-reporter-golunov-outcry\" title=\"\">to release an investigative reporter, Ivan Golunov</a>, who was framed by police; and the scrapping of controversial plans to build a cathedral in Yekaterinburg. In another country, this might have looked like responsive flexibility. In Russia, it looked like cracks in Putin\u2019s once impregnable authoritarian edifice.</p> \n<p>The conflicted faces of Putin are evident, too, in Russia\u2019s dealings around the globe. The Kremlin portrays him as a master statesman, out-thinking and out-foxing Russia\u2019s enemies and competitors. With Donald Trump, admittedly, that\u2019s not hard to do. The two men\u2019s last meeting, at the Osaka G7 summit, saw the US president again slavishly courting a leader who opposes much that the US traditionally stands for, and who, Democrats say, helped to get Trump elected by nefarious means.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/10/vladimir-putin-russia-rehabilitating-stalin-soviet-past\">Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is rehabilitating Stalin. We must not let it happen | Irina Sherbakova</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet Putin\u2019s global opportunism is not the success he likes to pretend. In Syria, where Moscow intervened on the side of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in 2015, Russian forces are stuck in what increasingly resembles a quagmire in the country\u2019s north-west. Putin\u2019s troops <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/22/russia-and-syria-step-up-airstrikes-against-civilians-in-idlib\" title=\"\">are again facing accusations of atrocities</a>, and of possible chemical weapons use, against the besieged civilian population of Idlib.</p> \n<p>At the same time, his military and diplomatic alliance with Iran and Turkey is cracking at the seams. Like his unfinished war in Ukraine, his risky meddling in Venezuela, and his covert war on exiled opponents, as seen in last year\u2019s Salisbury chemical attacks, Putin\u2019s international adventurism is proving politically and financially expensive, domestically unpopular, diplomatically isolating, and in the case of Syria, potentially disastrous.</p> \n<p>Last weekend\u2019s sudden lashing out against his opponents in Moscow speaks of rising panic. Behind Putin\u2019s smirking public face lies a well-founded sense of mortality.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator</p>",

Lack of diversification is another structural problem boding ill for the future. Russia\u2019s political and economic woes share one factor in common: Putin, and the self-serving, unrepresentative, opaque regime he runs. He insists, for example, that US and EU sanctions imposed after his illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea are not hurting Russia. Yet analysts estimate the sanctions provoked massive capital flight, in excess of $317bn, in ensuing years and continuing, dramatic falls in foreign direct investment. Putin\u2019s popularity, although still relatively high, is sharply down on previous levels. Signs of growing political weakness were discerned in recent decisions to bow to public pressure to release an investigative reporter, Ivan Golunov, who was framed by police; and the scrapping of controversial plans to build a cathedral in Yekaterinburg. In another country, this might have looked like responsive flexibility. In Russia, it looked like cracks in Putin\u2019s once impregnable authoritarian edifice. The conflicted faces of Putin are evident, too, in Russia\u2019s dealings around the globe. The Kremlin portrays him as a master statesman, out-thinking and out-foxing Russia\u2019s enemies and competitors. With Donald Trump, admittedly, that\u2019s not hard to do. The two men\u2019s last meeting, at the Osaka G7 summit, saw the US president again slavishly courting a leader who opposes much that the US traditionally stands for, and who, Democrats say, helped to get Trump elected by nefarious means. Yet Putin\u2019s global opportunism is not the success he likes to pretend. In Syria, where Moscow intervened on the side of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in 2015, Russian forces are stuck in what increasingly resembles a quagmire in the country\u2019s north-west. Putin\u2019s troops are again facing accusations of atrocities, and of possible chemical weapons use, against the besieged civilian population of Idlib. At the same time, his military and diplomatic alliance with Iran and Turkey is cracking at the seams. Like his unfinished war in Ukraine, his risky meddling in Venezuela, and his covert war on exiled opponents, as seen in last year\u2019s Salisbury chemical attacks, Putin\u2019s international adventurism is proving politically and financially expensive, domestically unpopular, diplomatically isolating, and in the case of Syria, potentially disastrous. Last weekend\u2019s sudden lashing out against his opponents in Moscow speaks of rising panic. Behind Putin\u2019s smirking public face lies a well-founded sense of mortality. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",

A US law firm that specialises in stock market litigation has filed the claim at the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The claim also targets US investment banks JP Morgan and Citigroup, and Switzerland\u2019s UBS. The legal action follows the European commission\u2019s decision in May to fine five banks more than \u20ac1bn (\u00a3910m) for colluding to reduce competition in markets for 11 currencies, including the US dollar, the euro and the pound. Cartels of traders with names such as the \u201cThree-Way Banana Split\u201d operated on chatrooms to rig the multitrillion-dollar foreign exchange market. UBS, which informed the commission about the collusion, was not fined but Japan\u2019s MUFG received a penalty. Scott + Scott, the law firm representing investors, said Barclays, RBS, JP Morgan, Citi and UBS had been fined more than $8.5bn by regulators globally over foreign exchange manipulation. The firm secured more than $2.3bn compensation in a US class action suit from banks including Barclays, RBS, UBS and Deutsche Bank. The claim, led by Michael O\u2019Higgins, the former chair of the Pensions Regulator, seeks compensation for investors and companies allegedly damaged by the banks\u2019 actions. O\u2019Higgins has instructed Scott + Scott to carry out work on the case. O\u2019Higgins said: \u201cJust as compensation has been won in the US, our legal action in the UK will seek to return hundreds of millions of pounds to pension funds and other corporates who were targeted by the cartel.\u201d Changes to the law in 2015 established opt-in collective legal actions that are akin to the long-established practice of class actions that have secured billions of dollars in compensation from tobacco companies, drug companies and others on behalf of consumers and investors. Under a class action a judge rules that all similar claimants will be included in the same claim, reducing litigation costs and sharing damages between claimants who might not have been able to afford to bring their own case. Until the 2015 law change, English law allowed opt-in collective actions, which made assembling a claim far more difficult and costly. The new regime has so far failed to get off the ground because of disagreements about the eligibility of claims. The value of the claim against the banks will depend on the number of foreign exchange trades carried out in London for UK-based operations and is likely to exceed \u00a31bn, O\u2019Higgins told Reuters.",

In the video, which was played to Westminster magistrates court at the opening of the trial on Monday, laughter can be heard as a cardboard model of the building is placed on a bonfire and set alight. Philip Stott, prosecuting, said Bussetti, 46, from South Norwood in south-east London, had been attending a friend\u2019s bonfire with about 30 others on 3 November last year.

      "body": "<p>Waitrose, Britain\u2019s largest retailer of game, is to ban the sale of birds shot with lead, as experts call on the government to ban its use.</p> <p>The move has been welcomed by the government\u2019s independent expert group, which concluded that there was no way to reduce the risk to human health and wildlife from lead shot other than by using alternative, non-toxic ammunition instead.</p> <p>After five years\u2019 research, the <a href=\"http://www.leadammunitiongroup.org.uk/\">Lead Ammunition Group</a> concluded in 2015 that 10,000 children were growing up in households where they were regularly eating sufficient game shot with lead ammunition to cause them \u201cneurodevelopmental harm and other health impairments\u201d. It also cited studies estimating that <a href=\"http://www.oxfordleadsymposium.info/wp-content/uploads/OLS_proceedings/papers/OLS_proceedings_pain_cromie_green.pdf\">50,000</a><a href=\"http://www.oxfordleadsymposium.info/wp-content/uploads/OLS_proceedings/papers/OLS_proceedings_pain_cromie_green.pdf\">-100,000 wildfowl were killed in Britain each year</a> because they had accidentally ingested spent gunshot, mistaking it for food.</p> <p>Lead bullets and shot fragment on impact with an animal, leaving tiny lead particles dispersed throughout the flesh. Predatory and scavenging birds, as well as people, consume lead fragments in the meat.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/29/use-safe-alternative-to-toxic-lead-gunshot\">In a letter to the Guardian</a>, a number of scientists and experts, including the former government adviser Prof Lord John Krebs and the Oxford academic Prof Christopher Perrins, have called on the government to take action on lead shot.</p> <p>Despite successive environment secretaries ignoring advice from the Lead Ammunition Group, an increasing number of commercial companies, organisations and states are banning lead shot. It is outlawed in the Netherlands and Denmark, where shooters use non-toxic steel and bismuth shot instead. This month, California banned lead ammunition for all hunting.</p> <p>Forest Enterprise England, which sells wild deer, has been using non-lead bullets since 2016. During this winter\u2019s shooting season, Waitrose will begin phasing out the use of lead shot on the estates from which it sources game. By the 2020-21 shooting season, all Waitrose\u2019s game will be \u201cbrought to bag\u201d without the use of lead ammunition.</p> <p>John Gregson, Waitrose\u2019s senior manager of agri-food communications, said: \u201cWe expect high standards from our game suppliers and have been really pleased with their support.\u201d</p> <p>John Swift, a former chief executive of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) who chairs the Lead Ammunition Group, welcomed Waitrose\u2019s move, but said the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs must take action to phase out lead shot.</p> <p>\u201cWaitrose deserve huge congratulations and they are showing real leadership and we need more of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can get rid of all these risks is to replace lead ammunition. Defra has got to pull its finger out and get the stakeholders around the table discussing the way forward.\u201d</p> <p>According to Swift, tradition and a fear that banning lead shot is an attack on the shooting industry is stopping Britain\u2019s shooting groups from backing a transition to non-toxic shot. He said the number of different shooting organisations had not helped, with rival bodies worried they would be caught \u201con the wrong side of the argument\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThere is an attitude nowadays that anything that potentially restricts countryside sports is an attack on countryside sports, so the wagons circle and the attack has to be repelled.

      "bodyText": "Waitrose, Britain\u2019s largest retailer of game, is to ban the sale of birds shot with lead, as experts call on the government to ban its use. The move has been welcomed by the government\u2019s independent expert group, which concluded that there was no way to reduce the risk to human health and wildlife from lead shot other than by using alternative, non-toxic ammunition instead. After five years\u2019 research, the Lead Ammunition Group concluded in 2015 that 10,000 children were growing up in households where they were regularly eating sufficient game shot with lead ammunition to cause them \u201cneurodevelopmental harm and other health impairments\u201d. It also cited studies estimating that 50,000-100,000 wildfowl were killed in Britain each year because they had accidentally ingested spent gunshot, mistaking it for food. Lead bullets and shot fragment on impact with an animal, leaving tiny lead particles dispersed throughout the flesh. Predatory and scavenging birds, as well as people, consume lead fragments in the meat. In a letter to the Guardian, a number of scientists and experts, including the former government adviser Prof Lord John Krebs and the Oxford academic Prof Christopher Perrins, have called on the government to take action on lead shot. Despite successive environment secretaries ignoring advice from the Lead Ammunition Group, an increasing number of commercial companies, organisations and states are banning lead shot. It is outlawed in the Netherlands and Denmark, where shooters use non-toxic steel and bismuth shot instead. This month, California banned lead ammunition for all hunting. Forest Enterprise England, which sells wild deer, has been using non-lead bullets since 2016. During this winter\u2019s shooting season, Waitrose will begin phasing out the use of lead shot on the estates from which it sources game. By the 2020-21 shooting season, all Waitrose\u2019s game will be \u201cbrought to bag\u201d without the use of lead ammunition. John Gregson, Waitrose\u2019s senior manager of agri-food communications, said: \u201cWe expect high standards from our game suppliers and have been really pleased with their support.\u201d John Swift, a former chief executive of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) who chairs the Lead Ammunition Group, welcomed Waitrose\u2019s move, but said the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs must take action to phase out lead shot. \u201cWaitrose deserve huge congratulations and they are showing real leadership and we need more of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can get rid of all these risks is to replace lead ammunition. Defra has got to pull its finger out and get the stakeholders around the table discussing the way forward.\u201d According to Swift, tradition and a fear that banning lead shot is an attack on the shooting industry is stopping Britain\u2019s shooting groups from backing a transition to non-toxic shot. He said the number of different shooting organisations had not helped, with rival bodies worried they would be caught \u201con the wrong side of the argument\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is an attitude nowadays that anything that potentially restricts countryside sports is an attack on countryside sports, so the wagons circle and the attack has to be repelled. That prevents them from engaging constructively with a process of change, which strikes me as eminently doable.\u201d The EU is considering a Europe-wide ban on lead ammunition for shooting game such as wildfowl on wetlands. Lead shot is banned on all wetlands in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales, there is a ban on using lead shot to shoot wildfowl and for shooting on foreshores and on sites of special scientific interest, but research in England has found that more than 70% of ducks were shot with lead.

And here lies the glaring omission in the Tory report, conspicuous by its absence but smouldering away behind the public school debate-club moralising: it is poverty and lack of social care that drive the most vulnerable into the most exploitative parts of prostitution.</p> <p>Throughout the whole 20,000 word report, austerity is <em>not mentioned</em> <em>once</em>. The word \u201cpoverty\u201d appears just a single time. If the authors really believe that all sex work is coercive, perhaps looking at the reasons women do this might have been useful.</p> <p>Omitted from the report was last month\u2019s admission by the Department for Work and Pensions that poverty caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/12/universal-credit-delays-a-factor-in-prostitution-government-accepts\">universal credit</a> is a major driver of prostitution. Likewise the fact that, under the Tories, <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/what-we-do/research-advocacy/universal-credit-and-foodbank-use/\">food bank usage</a> has skyrocketed. \u201cHomelessness\u201d is mentioned zero times, despite an irrefutable link between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/24/housing-secretary-james-brokenshire-admits-tory-policies-blame-homelessness-rise\">Tory policy and rough sleeping</a>. Discussion of trafficking is divorced from immigration policy, quotes about student debt are used to moralise about consent rather than highlight the need for an end to tuition fees and a frontline worker\u2019s statement that the \u201cpresent housing model is a poor fit for women experiencing multiple and complex needs\u201d triggers no self-reflection on the fact that women shoulder 86% of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/women-bearing-86-of-austerity-burden-labour-research-reveals\">austerity burden</a>. Not one sentence is dedicated to the link between brutal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/25/strip-dwp-work-pensions-responsibility-ill-disabled-people\">disability benefits failings</a> and prostitution.</p> <p>Admittedly, wading through the available evidence around prostitution is a huge task. It was undertaken by <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/amnesty-international-publishes-policy-and-research-on-protection-of-sex-workers-rights/\">Amnesty International in 2016</a>, resulting in the organisation\u2019s call for the full decriminalisation of sex work, a legal initiative also backed by the World Health Organisation, UNAIDS and sex worker-led organisations around the globe. In the UK, groups such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ukdecrimnow\">Decrim Now</a>, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProstitutesColl\">English Collective of Prostitutes</a> (ECP) and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SexWorkHive\">Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement</a> (Swarm) call for the same: full decriminalisation for safety\u2019s sake.</p> <p>The Tory report sums up the evidence and decides otherwise, suggesting that \u201cthe most effective way to safeguard sexual consent while reducing the market for prostitution \u2026 is to legislate to make paying for sexual services an offence\u201d. Criminalising clients \u2013 the so-called end demand or Nordic model \u2013 is all that Bruce and her team have to offer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/03/uk-feminists-embrace-sex-workers-rights\">Why UK feminists should embrace sex worker rights | Kate Hardy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s telling that, throughout the report, quotes from current sex workers float free from any input they have on legislation, functioning only to provide lurid detail or harrowing testimony.

And here lies the glaring omission in the Tory report, conspicuous by its absence but smouldering away behind the public school debate-club moralising: it is poverty and lack of social care that drive the most vulnerable into the most exploitative parts of prostitution. Throughout the whole 20,000 word report, austerity is not mentioned once. The word \u201cpoverty\u201d appears just a single time. If the authors really believe that all sex work is coercive, perhaps looking at the reasons women do this might have been useful. Omitted from the report was last month\u2019s admission by the Department for Work and Pensions that poverty caused by universal credit is a major driver of prostitution. Likewise the fact that, under the Tories, food bank usage has skyrocketed. \u201cHomelessness\u201d is mentioned zero times, despite an irrefutable link between Tory policy and rough sleeping. Discussion of trafficking is divorced from immigration policy, quotes about student debt are used to moralise about consent rather than highlight the need for an end to tuition fees and a frontline worker\u2019s statement that the \u201cpresent housing model is a poor fit for women experiencing multiple and complex needs\u201d triggers no self-reflection on the fact that women shoulder 86% of the austerity burden. Not one sentence is dedicated to the link between brutal disability benefits failings and prostitution. Admittedly, wading through the available evidence around prostitution is a huge task. It was undertaken by Amnesty International in 2016, resulting in the organisation\u2019s call for the full decriminalisation of sex work, a legal initiative also backed by the World Health Organisation, UNAIDS and sex worker-led organisations around the globe. In the UK, groups such as Decrim Now, the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP) and the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (Swarm) call for the same: full decriminalisation for safety\u2019s sake. The Tory report sums up the evidence and decides otherwise, suggesting that \u201cthe most effective way to safeguard sexual consent while reducing the market for prostitution \u2026 is to legislate to make paying for sexual services an offence\u201d. Criminalising clients \u2013 the so-called end demand or Nordic model \u2013 is all that Bruce and her team have to offer. It\u2019s telling that, throughout the report, quotes from current sex workers float free from any input they have on legislation, functioning only to provide lurid detail or harrowing testimony. And so the dots remain unconnected. Descriptions of poverty and illness sit in a vacuum and, free from responsibility, Tory party members can moralise about the obscenity of prostitution while the horror of austerity slides from sight. \u2022 Frankie Mullin is a freelance journalist.

      "body": "<p>Rex Richards, who has died aged 96, was a scientist driven not only by a personal thirst for discovery but by the satisfaction of creating conditions in which others could flourish.</p> <p>He was practical and inventive, but having helped to pioneer the application of a new method of analysis \u2013 nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR \u2013 to chemistry, biology and medicine, he devoted most of his energies to engineering the kinds of collaboration that would drive the subject forward.</p> <p>One consequence was that Britain rapidly acquired a world-leading position in the development of superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging body scanners.</p> <p>His research in the 1960s as a professor of chemistry at Oxford University depended on the development of large, superconducting magnets that could generate very powerful and uniform magnetic fields. Working in partnership with <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/people/martin-wood-12560/\" title=\"\">Martin Wood</a>, founder of the start-up company <a href=\"https://www.oxinst.com/\" title=\"\">Oxford Instruments</a> (OI), Richards and his colleagues stimulated the production of ever more powerful magnets, which OI sold commercially worldwide.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2003/mansfield/biographical/\" title=\"\">Peter Mansfield</a> at the University of Nottingham demonstrated that you could use NMR to produce images of the living body, OI was perfectly poised to produce the magnets he needed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has since revolutionised both clinical diagnosis and research in areas such as neuroscience, and Mansfield shared the Nobel prize for his discovery.</p> <p>Richards himself took a different path. NMR spectroscopy lines up the nuclei of atoms such as hydrogen in a magnetic field, then jolts them with a burst of radio waves that makes them jump to a different orientation. In doing so they transmit their own tiny signals, and the characteristic spectra of different molecules give insights into their structure and function.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69d726c11053443a38bd7a6f0a25cb3f6bb36419\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69d726c11053443a38bd7a6f0a25cb3f6bb36419/0_0_2560_2580/992.jpg\" alt=\"Rex Richards, 1977, acrylic on canvas, by Bryan Organ.\" width=\"992\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rex Richards, 1977, acrylic on canvas, by Bryan Organ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Bryan Organ and Merton College, Oxford; the Redfern Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the late 60s Richards was a key player in a British effort to exploit new technologies such as NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to understand the function of enzymes, molecules that act as catalysts for all the chemical reactions that keep the body alive.</p> <p>In an early venture into interdisciplinary working, independent of the rigid departmental structure of Oxford University, he and others came together as the <a href=\"http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/oeg/oeg.html\" title=\"\">Oxford Enzyme Group</a>. OEG was a loose collaboration of \u201c20 prima donnas\u201d from several departments that met fortnightly under Richards\u2019s chairmanship from 1969 until 1984.</p> <p>In 1970 they obtained a Science Research Council grant to buy a new magnet and associated equipment for studies of enzyme structure and function. In addition to these \u201ctest tube\u201d studies, researchers led by Richards and the biochemist <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/people/george-radda-12132/\" title=\"\">George Radda</a> carried out pioneering NMR research into biochemical processes within intact biological tissue, such as muscle. This led to the installation in 1983 of the first whole-body NMR spectroscopy unit to probe energy metabolism in human patients at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford.</p> <p>Richards described this period as \u201cvery thrilling\u201d, but by then he had already taken on the first of many administrative roles that would increasingly move him away from the laboratory bench.</p> <p>He served as warden of Merton College, Oxford (1969-84), and was vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford (1977-81). Aged 62 he began a 10-year tenure as director of the <a href=\"https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Leverhulme Trust</a>, a major funder of science and the arts.

      "bodyText": "Rex Richards, who has died aged 96, was a scientist driven not only by a personal thirst for discovery but by the satisfaction of creating conditions in which others could flourish. He was practical and inventive, but having helped to pioneer the application of a new method of analysis \u2013 nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR \u2013 to chemistry, biology and medicine, he devoted most of his energies to engineering the kinds of collaboration that would drive the subject forward. One consequence was that Britain rapidly acquired a world-leading position in the development of superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging body scanners. His research in the 1960s as a professor of chemistry at Oxford University depended on the development of large, superconducting magnets that could generate very powerful and uniform magnetic fields. Working in partnership with Martin Wood, founder of the start-up company Oxford Instruments (OI), Richards and his colleagues stimulated the production of ever more powerful magnets, which OI sold commercially worldwide. When Peter Mansfield at the University of Nottingham demonstrated that you could use NMR to produce images of the living body, OI was perfectly poised to produce the magnets he needed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has since revolutionised both clinical diagnosis and research in areas such as neuroscience, and Mansfield shared the Nobel prize for his discovery. Richards himself took a different path. NMR spectroscopy lines up the nuclei of atoms such as hydrogen in a magnetic field, then jolts them with a burst of radio waves that makes them jump to a different orientation. In doing so they transmit their own tiny signals, and the characteristic spectra of different molecules give insights into their structure and function. In the late 60s Richards was a key player in a British effort to exploit new technologies such as NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to understand the function of enzymes, molecules that act as catalysts for all the chemical reactions that keep the body alive. In an early venture into interdisciplinary working, independent of the rigid departmental structure of Oxford University, he and others came together as the Oxford Enzyme Group. OEG was a loose collaboration of \u201c20 prima donnas\u201d from several departments that met fortnightly under Richards\u2019s chairmanship from 1969 until 1984. In 1970 they obtained a Science Research Council grant to buy a new magnet and associated equipment for studies of enzyme structure and function. In addition to these \u201ctest tube\u201d studies, researchers led by Richards and the biochemist George Radda carried out pioneering NMR research into biochemical processes within intact biological tissue, such as muscle. This led to the installation in 1983 of the first whole-body NMR spectroscopy unit to probe energy metabolism in human patients at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. Richards described this period as \u201cvery thrilling\u201d, but by then he had already taken on the first of many administrative roles that would increasingly move him away from the laboratory bench. He served as warden of Merton College, Oxford (1969-84), and was vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford (1977-81). Aged 62 he began a 10-year tenure as director of the Leverhulme Trust, a major funder of science and the arts. Finding its grant-making systems impossibly antiquated and laborious, he spent every weekend for a year personally programming a computer database to manage them. Born in Colyton, Devon, Rex was the son of Harold Richards, a builder and timber valuer, and his wife, Edith (nee Humphries), who managed her husband\u2019s business. Rex attended Colyton grammar school and then studied chemistry at St John\u2019s College, Oxford, contributing to research in infrared spectroscopy with HW \u201cTommy\u201d Thompson and, after graduating with a first in 1945, completing a doctorate. The American physicists Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell had recently demonstrated the phenomenon of NMR, and, looking for research to call his own, Richards saw that it could have applications in chemistry. Despite an initial rebuff from the only Oxford physicist with expertise in the area, he built his own equipment, getting the Cowley motor works in Oxford to cast the iron for his magnet and winding miles of copper wire with his own hands.

Richards was renowned for his skill on committees: among many other positions, he chaired the British Postgraduate Medical Federation, which ran several specialist London hospitals, and headed a task force on clinical academic careers. His serious appreciation of contemporary art found him serving as a trustee of both the Tate Gallery and the National Gallery. He was a friend of Henry Moore, and chaired the trustees of the Henry Moore Foundation. Richards and his wife, Eva (nee Vago), were discerning buyers of contemporary British art, both for themselves and other organisations.

      "body": "<p>It could be a wedding invitation. Perhaps a job interview is coming up. Or maybe it\u2019s just a big night out. There are many reasons people shop for new clothes. But environmentally conscious and cash savvy consumers are increasingly opting to rent rather than buy when they want a new outfit.</p> <p>Fashion rental is on the rise and not just for event wear. Where once someone may only have hired a tuxedo or formal wear for a special occasion, today companies are renting customers everyday clothing, handbags, even trainers for one-off fees or via low-cost subscription. Designer labels, children\u2019s clothes and maternity wear are also proving popular with consumers who are reluctant to invest in items they may not need for long or those who want to keep up with fashion without feeding mass consumption.</p> <p>\u201cThe benefits of renting fashion are wide-ranging,\u201d says Samantha Dover, senior retail analyst at research firm Mintel. \u201cNot only can renting clothes be a more environmentally friendly alternative to buying into fast-moving fashion trends, but consumers can also save space in their homes. Fashion rentals can fulfil temporary fashion, such as clothing for women during pregnancy, while some fashion rental companies are tapping into demand for more niche and everyday fashion products such as streetwear.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/29/fast-fashion-giving-way-sustainable-wardrobe\">Is fast fashion giving way to the sustainable wardrobe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Evidence suggests people are already shopping less frequently. The percentage of those buying clothes every two to three months declined between 2017 and 2018, according to Mintel, while there was a marked increase in those shopping just once a year. Importantly, there has been a consistent fall in the percentage of shoppers indulging their habit once a month or more.</p> <p>The US has led the way in fashion rental with market leader <a href=\"https://www.renttherunway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rent the Runway</a>, operating since 2009. It offers users unlimited rentals for a regular monthly subscription of $159 (\u00a3127). The UK has been slower to catch on to the rental trend, though several services have emerged in recent years. <a href=\"https://www.girlmeetsdress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Girl Meets Dress</a> has a monthly fee of \u00a399, for which subscribers can have unlimited dress hires. Wear the Walk, <a href=\"https://www.mywardrobehq.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">My Wardrobe HQ</a> and <a href=\"https://frontrow.uk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Front Row</a> rent out high end and designer labels for a monthly subscription, plus a rental fee for each item, typically between 10% and 15% of the retail price. Meanwhile, Dutch label <a href=\"https://www.scotch-soda.com/gb/en/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scotch &amp; Soda</a> recently announced plans to launch a men\u2019s clothing rental service this autumn.</p> <p>Sacha Newall, founder of My Wardrobe HQ, believes that renting clothes will become the norm in future and could address growing concerns about the negative impacts of fast fashion. \u201cI used to work in the car sharing industry, where for every car shared 11 are taken off the road,\u201d she says. \u201cApply a similar approach to the crisis in the fashion industry and you have the potential to make a real difference.\u201d</p> <p>Consumers are beginning to wake up to the effect that cheap, throwaway fashion is having. A damning parliamentary committee report recently outlined the contribution of the fashion industry to climate change. The findings were stark: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/28/stella-mccartney-calls-for-overhaul-of-incredibly-wasteful-fashion-industry\">the textile industry creates 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 a year</a>, and is responsible for the consumption of vast quantities of water, while <a href=\"https://environmentjournal.online/articles/35-of-microplastics-in-oceans-come-from-clothing-research-reveals/\" rel=\"nofollow\">35% of the microplastics in the ocean come from the synthetic fibres in abandoned clothing</a>.</p> <p>Newall adds: \u201cRental can be for fun. It\u2019s a one-night stand. But you can look good with the virtue factor of knowing you haven\u2019t done any damage to the environment.\u201d</p> <p>While more people are aware of the damage fast-moving, disposable fashion is doing to the planet, social media is encouraging consumption of clothing among some users. One in six young people say they do not feel able to wear an outfit again once it has appeared on social media, a <a href=\"https://www.hubbub.org.uk/blog/can-the-fashion-industry-become-sustainable\" rel=\"nofollow\">study</a> by charity the <a href=\"https://www.hubbub.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hubbub Foundation</a> found.

      "bodyText": "It could be a wedding invitation. Perhaps a job interview is coming up. Or maybe it\u2019s just a big night out. There are many reasons people shop for new clothes. But environmentally conscious and cash savvy consumers are increasingly opting to rent rather than buy when they want a new outfit. Fashion rental is on the rise and not just for event wear. Where once someone may only have hired a tuxedo or formal wear for a special occasion, today companies are renting customers everyday clothing, handbags, even trainers for one-off fees or via low-cost subscription. Designer labels, children\u2019s clothes and maternity wear are also proving popular with consumers who are reluctant to invest in items they may not need for long or those who want to keep up with fashion without feeding mass consumption. \u201cThe benefits of renting fashion are wide-ranging,\u201d says Samantha Dover, senior retail analyst at research firm Mintel. \u201cNot only can renting clothes be a more environmentally friendly alternative to buying into fast-moving fashion trends, but consumers can also save space in their homes. Fashion rentals can fulfil temporary fashion, such as clothing for women during pregnancy, while some fashion rental companies are tapping into demand for more niche and everyday fashion products such as streetwear.\u201d Evidence suggests people are already shopping less frequently. The percentage of those buying clothes every two to three months declined between 2017 and 2018, according to Mintel, while there was a marked increase in those shopping just once a year. Importantly, there has been a consistent fall in the percentage of shoppers indulging their habit once a month or more. The US has led the way in fashion rental with market leader Rent the Runway, operating since 2009. It offers users unlimited rentals for a regular monthly subscription of $159 (\u00a3127). The UK has been slower to catch on to the rental trend, though several services have emerged in recent years. Girl Meets Dress has a monthly fee of \u00a399, for which subscribers can have unlimited dress hires. Wear the Walk, My Wardrobe HQ and Front Row rent out high end and designer labels for a monthly subscription, plus a rental fee for each item, typically between 10% and 15% of the retail price. Meanwhile, Dutch label Scotch &amp; Soda recently announced plans to launch a men\u2019s clothing rental service this autumn. Sacha Newall, founder of My Wardrobe HQ, believes that renting clothes will become the norm in future and could address growing concerns about the negative impacts of fast fashion. \u201cI used to work in the car sharing industry, where for every car shared 11 are taken off the road,\u201d she says. \u201cApply a similar approach to the crisis in the fashion industry and you have the potential to make a real difference.\u201d Consumers are beginning to wake up to the effect that cheap, throwaway fashion is having. A damning parliamentary committee report recently outlined the contribution of the fashion industry to climate change. The findings were stark: the textile industry creates 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 a year, and is responsible for the consumption of vast quantities of water, while 35% of the microplastics in the ocean come from the synthetic fibres in abandoned clothing. Newall adds: \u201cRental can be for fun. It\u2019s a one-night stand. But you can look good with the virtue factor of knowing you haven\u2019t done any damage to the environment.\u201d While more people are aware of the damage fast-moving, disposable fashion is doing to the planet, social media is encouraging consumption of clothing among some users. One in six young people say they do not feel able to wear an outfit again once it has appeared on social media, a study by charity the Hubbub Foundation found. Almost half of young women polled said they felt the need to wear a different look every time they went out. \u201cThe increase in fashion rental should drive the production of clothes that are more durable, which is good in terms of sustainability,\u201d says Heather Poore, Hubbub\u2019s creative director. \u201cBut the rental model is new and still being tested. A lot of the focus is on high-end items. The real strength of it will become evident when the big, everyday brands start to trial it. Plus, you have to balance the potential mass scale of rental with sustainable ways to get clothes to people. Online deliveries already have a big environmental impact.\u201d Urban Outfitters is one of the bigger names to announce a rental offering.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is moving into Downing Street with his partner, Carrie Symonds, after weeks of speculation about whether she would join him. The new prime minister will occupy the large flat above No 11, despite the chancellor, Sajid Javid, having a bigger family with four young children. Johnson\u2019s deputy spokeswoman said the couple would be moving in officially on Monday, with Symonds taking up residence there with him. There had been speculation that she might not join him in Downing Street after she was seen moving furniture into a house in south-east London with her mother. Johnson and his partner have not been seen publicly together since they were recorded by a neighbour in Camberwell having a late-night row during the leadership contest. However, Symonds joined staff members and supporters of Johnson outside the steps of No 10 as he entered for the first time as prime minister last week. Johnson split with his second wife, Marina, last September. The couple had been together for 25 years. Johnson is not thought to be moving any of his children into Downing Street, and the spokeswoman declined to comment on whether they would get police protection as members of the prime minister\u2019s family. After reports that Johnson had asked for new furniture to be bought, his spokeswoman said: \u201cThere will not be any additional cost to the taxpayer of her [Symonds] living there.\u201d Symonds is not believed be getting taxpayer support for an adviser or a clothing budget as some previous occupants of Downing Street have done. Javid is expected to stay in his family home in west London rather than move to the two-bedroom flat above No 10.",

Days before securing promotion at Wembley in May, Dean Smith and the chief executive, Christian Purslow, deemed that a victory parade would be overindulgent, a decision that spooked Birmingham city council, which feared a backlash from fans who assumed they were the party-poopers. \u201cWe had an identical reaction, which was: \u2018We\u2019re Aston Villa, we have parades when we win cups, when we win leagues, not when we get promoted effectively in third,\u2019\u201d Purslow said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-2019-20-preview-arsenal-unai-emery-champions-league-pepe\">Premier League 2019\u201120 preview No 1: Arsenal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What has followed that soundbite has affirmed that whiff of ambition, with more than \u00a3100m of players signed and an overdue clearance of dead wood; Micah Richards and Ross McCormack, who had not played for Villa for five years between them, are off the wage bill. More influential servants, such as Albert Adomah, Alan Hutton and Glenn Whelan, have also departed, albeit arguably 12 months too late. Given that Villa plan to build on the dynamism that rocketed them up the Championship in spring, when a boisterous midfield axis of Jack Grealish, the bustling John McGinn and Conor Hourihane propelled them into the play-off picture on the back of a 10-game winning streak, the last thing Smith needed looking back at him at Bodymoor Heath this summer was a greying squad.</p> \n<p>The scale of Villa\u2019s summer business has whipped up no end of optimism among fans \u2013 almost 5,000 travelled to Shrewsbury for a pre-season friendly \u2013 but while there is intrigue, there is also scepticism beyond B6 at how Villa have spent big on players with little top-flight experience; of the 11 signings, only Tyrone Mings and Matt Targett, who combined cost more than \u00a335m, have played in the Premier League, with 46 starts between them. Mings made himself a cult hero in half a season at Villa Park, which allowed Bournemouth to hike the asking price to \u00a326.5m, including clauses, such as whether the defender plays for England or Villa qualify for Europe. But given how strongly Villa finished last season \u2013 losing twice since mid-February \u2013 a move for Mings was seen as a no-brainer.</p> \n<p>It was important for Smith to strengthen a backline that had a tendency to self-destruct but five new defenders should reinforce a rearguard that conceded more goals last season than Stoke and Birmingham, who finished 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> respectively. Targett, who played second fiddle at Southampton, can be bullied by more wily wingers but Ezri Konsa is perhaps the pick of the bunch, with Smith describing the centre-back, who joined Villa for \u00a312m after a season at Brentford, as having \u201cunlimited potential\u201d. Konsa, previously trailed by Arsenal, was one of two England players at the European Under-21 Championship not contracted to a Premier League club and Smith believes senior international recognition will, one day, be within his grasp.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/astonvillaposition-zip/giv-3902WS7a3uNY3emA/\" data-alt=\"Past five seasons\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/astonvillaposition-zip/giv-3902WS7a3uNY3emA/\">Past five seasons</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Then there is Mahmoud Hassan \u2013 best known as Trezeguet \u2013 and the \u00a322m club-record signing, Wesley, who will need to fill the goalscoring void left by Tammy Abraham. Jota, the silky winger who arrived from Birmingham the week after promotion, has helped the Spanish-speaking striker settle. Villa have been bold because, as Purslow put it, they have \u201cno interest in flirting with the catastrophe of relegation\u201d. In Smith, they have a manager who has earned the chance to coach at the highest level, having made people sit up and take notice at Walsall, Brentford and now Villa. That the club is ingrained in Smith \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/26/dean-smith-aston-villa-championship-play-off-final-derby\">stories of him sweeping terraces</a> in the Holte End while his father, Ron, worked as a steward in the Trinity Road Stand have been well documented \u2013 adds to the gusto with which Villa return to the top table.</p> \n<p>Despite all the fresh blood, a more familiar face is most likely to provide a touch of class: the boy who used to run into the bushes of the back garden as a kid pretending to embrace the Holte End and conducted the impromptu singalong to toast promotion from the balcony of the team hotel in May. When Grealish plays well, so do Villa. The numbers suggest his influence is even stronger; of the 15 league games he did not start last season, Villa won three, compared with the 19 they won from 31 with him. The 23-year-old appears to have matured and, although still overburdened, the player who was fouled 158 times last season, more than anyone else in the Championship, is a slicker, sleeker and stronger force.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/archive-zip/giv-3902uQ7tV57g9Uxc/\" data-alt=\"Last season's results\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/archive-zip/giv-3902uQ7tV57g9Uxc/\">Last season's results</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Grealish has spent three years looking in at the Premier League from the outside, including at his friends Dele Alli and Harry Winks at Tottenham, where Villa play on the opening day, and has another chance to share that stage and address a sense of unfinished business. \u201cThe day we got relegated [in 2016], it was always in my mind to get Villa back,\u201d said Grealish, who made his top-flight debut in 2014. \u201cWhen I was 19, 20, maybe I took it for granted a little bit \u2013 I didn\u2019t realise how lucky I was to be playing with Villa in the Premier League and now I\u2019m back there I need to grab it with both hands. Hopefully I can push this club as high as possible in the league and get goals, get assists and, for me, what I want to do this season is get into the England team.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"68bc874c-c080-4efb-98c1-cd42665645cc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>No 1:</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-2019-20-preview-arsenal-unai-emery-champions-league-pepe\">Arsenal</a><br><b>No 2:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-201920-preview-no-2-aston-villa\">Aston Villa</a><br><b>No 3:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-2019-20-preview-bournemouth-eddie-howe\">Bournemouth</a><br><b>No 4:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-201920-preview-no-4-brighton\">Brighton</a><br><b>No 5:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-5-burnley\">Burnley</a><br><b>No 6:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-6-chelsea\">Chelsea</a><br><b>No 7:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-2019-20-preview-crystal-palace-hodgson-zaha\">Crystal Palace</a><br><b>No 8:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-201920-preview-no-8-everton\">Everton</a><br><b>No 9:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-2019-20-preview-leicester-brendan-rodgers-perez-tielemans\">Leicester City</a><br><b>No 10:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-201920-preview-no-10-liverpool\">Liverpool</a><br><b>No 11:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-11-manchester-city\">Manchester City</a><br><b>No 12:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-12-manchester-united\">Manchester United</a><br><b>No 13:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-13-newcastle-united\">Newcastle United</a><br><b>No 14:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-14-norwich-city\">Norwich City</a><br><b>No 15:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-15-sheffield-united\">Sheffield United</a><br><b>No 16:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-16-southampton\">Southampton</a><br><b>No 17:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-17-tottenham\">Tottenham Hotspur</a><br><b>No 18:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-18-watford\">Watford</a><br><b>No 19:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-19-west-ham\">West Ham</a><br><b>No 20:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-20-wolves\">Wolves</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Villa\u2019s aggressive recruitment drive has drawn comparisons to Fulham, who splurged \u00a3120m last summer before things quickly went south, doomed, in effect, by the end of November.

Of the team that started the play-off final two months ago, only a handful of players \u2013 Grealish, McGinn, Mingsand possibly Hourihane \u2013 are likely to begin the new season at Spurs.

      "bodyText": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 15th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben Fisher\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 5th in the Championship Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 1,000-1 It was a conversation that apparently lasted fewer than 10 seconds but was an early indicator that Aston Villa have zero appetite to make up the numbers on their Premier League return. Days before securing promotion at Wembley in May, Dean Smith and the chief executive, Christian Purslow, deemed that a victory parade would be overindulgent, a decision that spooked Birmingham city council, which feared a backlash from fans who assumed they were the party-poopers. \u201cWe had an identical reaction, which was: \u2018We\u2019re Aston Villa, we have parades when we win cups, when we win leagues, not when we get promoted effectively in third,\u2019\u201d Purslow said. What has followed that soundbite has affirmed that whiff of ambition, with more than \u00a3100m of players signed and an overdue clearance of dead wood; Micah Richards and Ross McCormack, who had not played for Villa for five years between them, are off the wage bill. More influential servants, such as Albert Adomah, Alan Hutton and Glenn Whelan, have also departed, albeit arguably 12 months too late. Given that Villa plan to build on the dynamism that rocketed them up the Championship in spring, when a boisterous midfield axis of Jack Grealish, the bustling John McGinn and Conor Hourihane propelled them into the play-off picture on the back of a 10-game winning streak, the last thing Smith needed looking back at him at Bodymoor Heath this summer was a greying squad. The scale of Villa\u2019s summer business has whipped up no end of optimism among fans \u2013 almost 5,000 travelled to Shrewsbury for a pre-season friendly \u2013 but while there is intrigue, there is also scepticism beyond B6 at how Villa have spent big on players with little top-flight experience; of the 11 signings, only Tyrone Mings and Matt Targett, who combined cost more than \u00a335m, have played in the Premier League, with 46 starts between them. Mings made himself a cult hero in half a season at Villa Park, which allowed Bournemouth to hike the asking price to \u00a326.5m, including clauses, such as whether the defender plays for England or Villa qualify for Europe. But given how strongly Villa finished last season \u2013 losing twice since mid-February \u2013 a move for Mings was seen as a no-brainer. It was important for Smith to strengthen a backline that had a tendency to self-destruct but five new defenders should reinforce a rearguard that conceded more goals last season than Stoke and Birmingham, who finished 16th and 17th respectively. Targett, who played second fiddle at Southampton, can be bullied by more wily wingers but Ezri Konsa is perhaps the pick of the bunch, with Smith describing the centre-back, who joined Villa for \u00a312m after a season at Brentford, as having \u201cunlimited potential\u201d. Konsa, previously trailed by Arsenal, was one of two England players at the European Under-21 Championship not contracted to a Premier League club and Smith believes senior international recognition will, one day, be within his grasp. Then there is Mahmoud Hassan \u2013 best known as Trezeguet \u2013 and the \u00a322m club-record signing, Wesley, who will need to fill the goalscoring void left by Tammy Abraham. Jota, the silky winger who arrived from Birmingham the week after promotion, has helped the Spanish-speaking striker settle. Villa have been bold because, as Purslow put it, they have \u201cno interest in flirting with the catastrophe of relegation\u201d. In Smith, they have a manager who has earned the chance to coach at the highest level, having made people sit up and take notice at Walsall, Brentford and now Villa. That the club is ingrained in Smith \u2013 stories of him sweeping terraces in the Holte End while his father, Ron, worked as a steward in the Trinity Road Stand have been well documented \u2013 adds to the gusto with which Villa return to the top table. Despite all the fresh blood, a more familiar face is most likely to provide a touch of class: the boy who used to run into the bushes of the back garden as a kid pretending to embrace the Holte End and conducted the impromptu singalong to toast promotion from the balcony of the team hotel in May. When Grealish plays well, so do Villa. The numbers suggest his influence is even stronger; of the 15 league games he did not start last season, Villa won three, compared with the 19 they won from 31 with him. The 23-year-old appears to have matured and, although still overburdened, the player who was fouled 158 times last season, more than anyone else in the Championship, is a slicker, sleeker and stronger force. Grealish has spent three years looking in at the Premier League from the outside, including at his friends Dele Alli and Harry Winks at Tottenham, where Villa play on the opening day, and has another chance to share that stage and address a sense of unfinished business. \u201cThe day we got relegated [in 2016], it was always in my mind to get Villa back,\u201d said Grealish, who made his top-flight debut in 2014. \u201cWhen I was 19, 20, maybe I took it for granted a little bit \u2013 I didn\u2019t realise how lucky I was to be playing with Villa in the Premier League and now I\u2019m back there I need to grab it with both hands. Hopefully I can push this club as high as possible in the league and get goals, get assists and, for me, what I want to do this season is get into the England team.\u201d Villa\u2019s aggressive recruitment drive has drawn comparisons to Fulham, who splurged \u00a3120m last summer before things quickly went south, doomed, in effect, by the end of November. Purslow disagrees. \u201cThere will be people who don\u2019t follow these things closely, who think we are just another promoted team, who will struggle and likely go straight back down,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one, not least me and Dean Smith, believes that is the case. I could not be more confident in the team. I think we are going to have a fantastic season.\u201d Equally confident Villa supporters may point to Wolves\u2019 upward trajectory since promotion as an alternative example of where ambition can lead but, while Villa\u2019s approach appears rational, the challenge for Smith will be integrating a minibus of signings into his well-oiled Villa machine, backed by billionaire owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens. Of the team that started the play-off final two months ago, only a handful of players \u2013 Grealish, McGinn, Mingsand possibly Hourihane \u2013 are likely to begin the new season at Spurs. It remains to be seen whether that is a good or a bad thing.",

      "body": "<p>When their children were young, Karen and David took them to a noisy restaurant. Their two-year-old daughter was being loud and excitable, as toddlers tend to be, and David suddenly got up and walked out. There were many incidents like that during their first 12 years of marriage, which would often leave David feeling frustrated, and Karen sad, lonely and confused.</p> <p>Then, when their son was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) \u2013 the term now widely used for all autism diagnoses, including Asperger syndrome \u2013 it became clear that David had the condition, too. Eventually, he had a formal diagnosis. Their marriage is much happier. \u201cI am now much better equipped to understand why I may find neurotypical relationships so confusing,\u201d says David, \u201cand it has been the foundation of improving my relationship with Karen.\u201d</p> <p>Karen says she often used to feel exasperated by David\u2019s mood swings and what she saw as his tendency to blow small problems out of proportion. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand it because he was the most loving, generous person much of the time.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks to the diagnosis, \u201cafter 12 years of not understanding each other, I started to see that he couldn\u2019t help his behaviour. He wasn\u2019t a bad person.\u201d</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a figure for the number of adults diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum each year but, anecdotally, it is on the rise. More than 1% of the population has autism, so there will be many adults who suspect or are unaware that they have the condition \u2013 and many who will be in relationships with people considered neurotypical. For many people, it is picked up if their child is diagnosed, as was the case with David (there is thought to be a hereditary aspect). But another common pathway is if their partner suspects ASD and encourages them to look into it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32930a3a79d5239e35229eceb129b0318539cee1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32930a3a79d5239e35229eceb129b0318539cee1/0_0_5075_3045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura James \u2026 \u2018Autistic women tend to be quite straightforward and honest.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura James \u2026 \u2018Autistic women tend to be quite straightforward and honest.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim James</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is by no means a certainty that a relationship between someone with ASD and someone without will be difficult \u2013 every person with ASD is different, as is every relationship. But a diagnosis can come as a relief for both partners.</p> <p>Before he was diagnosed last year at the age of 30, Robert (not his real name) says his wife referred to him \u201cas having \u2018quirks\u2019 \u2013 such as wearing earplugs all the time or needing to sit next to walls, or with my back to them. I have since become aware that she makes an effort to help me with these things such as finding suitable tables in coffee shops or making sure I can sit at the back of a bus so nobody can sit behind me.\u201d</p> <p>The diagnosis has made sense of a lot of his life, he says. \u201cI find it very hard to maintain relationships with other people. I have no social circle, although I do find that social media helps me interact with people I would normally struggle with. I felt immensely guilty that I didn\u2019t have those relationships \u2013 and more guilty for not really being bothered that I didn\u2019t have them. Receiving a diagnosis has taught me that it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>It has also helped explain some of his actions to his wife. \u201cI have become acutely aware of how obsessed I become over things, something that has caused issues with my wife. She understands now that sometimes it\u2019s easier just to let them run their course.\u201d</p> <p>There are still misunderstandings, though. Robert has depression, which led to him leaving his job at a local authority. His wife, he says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand that I forget to take medication, I struggle ringing people [to seek help], and, when I do get to speak to people, I can\u2019t articulate myself, so I\u2019m not able to get the help I want or need. That causes a huge amount of stress between us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the characteristics of ASD can be [that the person has] two characters,\u201d says Tony Attwood, a clinical psychologist and expert on Asperger syndrome. \u201cThey are able to socialise in a work environment, but it\u2019s very arduous and exhausting. When they come home, they want isolation to recover, or to recover by engaging in their special interest \u2013 but their partner often feels left out of their life.\u201d</p> <p>Generalisations only go so far, but Attwood says he has seen common themes in the conflicts that can occur. \u201cThe person with autism may not read the signals when their partner needs affection, consoling or compassion, and may not respond as anticipated, which then leads the neurotypical person feeling that the other person may not care. They do care, but they\u2019re not good at reading the signals.\u201d The partner with ASD, meanwhile, may \u201cneed less frequent and intense expressions of affection. There may be an imbalance in the relationship between what one partner needs and what the other is expected to give.\u201d Attwood says he recently asked a couple for their definition of \u201clove\u201d. The husband, who was on the spectrum, \u201cthought for 10 or 20 seconds and said \u2018loyalty\u2019, which is an appropriate expression of love. But his partner was looking for more passion.\u201d</p> <p>Again, it is a generalisation, but Attwood says partners with ASD tend to be loyal and honest. \u201cThe person is very kind in many ways and very caring, but may have a different way of showing it.\u201d <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8578.2010.00466.x\" title=\"\">A 2010 study published</a> in the British Journal of Special Education (and <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/about/communication/sex-education/top-tips.aspx\">referred to by the National Autistic Society</a>) interviewed young autistic people and found that many said that, when they were younger, they would have benefited from more education about how relationships work.

      "bodyText": "When their children were young, Karen and David took them to a noisy restaurant. Their two-year-old daughter was being loud and excitable, as toddlers tend to be, and David suddenly got up and walked out. There were many incidents like that during their first 12 years of marriage, which would often leave David feeling frustrated, and Karen sad, lonely and confused. Then, when their son was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) \u2013 the term now widely used for all autism diagnoses, including Asperger syndrome \u2013 it became clear that David had the condition, too. Eventually, he had a formal diagnosis. Their marriage is much happier. \u201cI am now much better equipped to understand why I may find neurotypical relationships so confusing,\u201d says David, \u201cand it has been the foundation of improving my relationship with Karen.\u201d Karen says she often used to feel exasperated by David\u2019s mood swings and what she saw as his tendency to blow small problems out of proportion. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand it because he was the most loving, generous person much of the time.\u201d Thanks to the diagnosis, \u201cafter 12 years of not understanding each other, I started to see that he couldn\u2019t help his behaviour. He wasn\u2019t a bad person.\u201d There isn\u2019t a figure for the number of adults diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum each year but, anecdotally, it is on the rise. More than 1% of the population has autism, so there will be many adults who suspect or are unaware that they have the condition \u2013 and many who will be in relationships with people considered neurotypical. For many people, it is picked up if their child is diagnosed, as was the case with David (there is thought to be a hereditary aspect). But another common pathway is if their partner suspects ASD and encourages them to look into it. It is by no means a certainty that a relationship between someone with ASD and someone without will be difficult \u2013 every person with ASD is different, as is every relationship. But a diagnosis can come as a relief for both partners. Before he was diagnosed last year at the age of 30, Robert (not his real name) says his wife referred to him \u201cas having \u2018quirks\u2019 \u2013 such as wearing earplugs all the time or needing to sit next to walls, or with my back to them. I have since become aware that she makes an effort to help me with these things such as finding suitable tables in coffee shops or making sure I can sit at the back of a bus so nobody can sit behind me.\u201d The diagnosis has made sense of a lot of his life, he says. \u201cI find it very hard to maintain relationships with other people. I have no social circle, although I do find that social media helps me interact with people I would normally struggle with. I felt immensely guilty that I didn\u2019t have those relationships \u2013 and more guilty for not really being bothered that I didn\u2019t have them. Receiving a diagnosis has taught me that it\u2019s OK.\u201d It has also helped explain some of his actions to his wife. \u201cI have become acutely aware of how obsessed I become over things, something that has caused issues with my wife. She understands now that sometimes it\u2019s easier just to let them run their course.\u201d There are still misunderstandings, though. Robert has depression, which led to him leaving his job at a local authority. His wife, he says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand that I forget to take medication, I struggle ringing people [to seek help], and, when I do get to speak to people, I can\u2019t articulate myself, so I\u2019m not able to get the help I want or need. That causes a huge amount of stress between us.\u201d \u201cOne of the characteristics of ASD can be [that the person has] two characters,\u201d says Tony Attwood, a clinical psychologist and expert on Asperger syndrome. \u201cThey are able to socialise in a work environment, but it\u2019s very arduous and exhausting. When they come home, they want isolation to recover, or to recover by engaging in their special interest \u2013 but their partner often feels left out of their life.\u201d Generalisations only go so far, but Attwood says he has seen common themes in the conflicts that can occur. \u201cThe person with autism may not read the signals when their partner needs affection, consoling or compassion, and may not respond as anticipated, which then leads the neurotypical person feeling that the other person may not care. They do care, but they\u2019re not good at reading the signals.\u201d The partner with ASD, meanwhile, may \u201cneed less frequent and intense expressions of affection. There may be an imbalance in the relationship between what one partner needs and what the other is expected to give.\u201d Attwood says he recently asked a couple for their definition of \u201clove\u201d. The husband, who was on the spectrum, \u201cthought for 10 or 20 seconds and said \u2018loyalty\u2019, which is an appropriate expression of love. But his partner was looking for more passion.\u201d Again, it is a generalisation, but Attwood says partners with ASD tend to be loyal and honest. \u201cThe person is very kind in many ways and very caring, but may have a different way of showing it.\u201d A 2010 study published in the British Journal of Special Education (and referred to by the National Autistic Society) interviewed young autistic people and found that many said that, when they were younger, they would have benefited from more education about how relationships work. More recently, a 2017 Swedish study found that one out of five individuals with autistic traits felt they did not fit accepted labels for sexual orientation; they were also more likely to identify as bisexual than individuals without autistic traits. Advocates said the study showed the need to hear more from autistic people about their experience of sexual identity, and to be open to more diverse interpretations of it. In March, the comedian Amy Schumer talked about her husband, Chris Fischer, and his ASD diagnosis, in her Netflix standup special. \u201cAll the characteristics that make it clear that he is on the spectrum are all of the reasons that I fell madly in love with him,\u201d she says in her show. \u201cHe says whatever is on his mind. He keeps it so real. He doesn\u2019t care about social norms, or what you expect him to say or do \u2026 he can\u2019t lie. Is that the dream man?\u201d Interviewed later about his diagnosis, she said: \u201cIt has been totally positive \u2026 The tools that we have been given have made his life so much better and our marriage and our life more manageable, so I just wanted to encourage people to not be afraid of that stigma.\u201d Many relationships are long and happy, says Attwood \u2013 \u201cbut often, there have been adjustments to what to expect in the relationship\u201d. Counselling can help with this, but only if the counsellor has experience of dealing with autism. There are also organisations, such as Different Together, to support partners of those with Asperger\u2019s. \u201cI actually think there\u2019s an argument that autistic women are really great when married to neurotypical men,\u201d says Laura James, the author of Odd Girl Out, a memoir about being diagnosed with ASD in her 40s, and an ambassador for the National Autistic Society. \u201cMen in relationships often say: \u2018I don\u2019t know what my wife wants me to say\u2019 or \u2018If I upset her, she says everything is fine when I know it\u2019s not.\u2019 Autistic women tend to be \u2013 although I can\u2019t speak for everyone \u2013 quite straightforward and honest.

      "bodyText": "A couple of miles south of Birmingham\u2019s bustling Bullring sits the city\u2019s very own bear pit, at least as far as visiting Australian cricketers are concerned. The Ashes begin on Thursday at Edgbaston, a ground where none of the current tourists have tasted victory bar their mentor Steve Waugh, who captained the last team to do so in 2001, and their coach, Justin Langer, who was running the drinks. Some 15 visits since have been a case of pain or rain across all formats, with a draw and nine defeats. Just three weeks ago their one-day side were hit by Chris Woakes, Jofra Archer and a wall of Brummie noise when handed a first defeat in a World Cup semi-final. The atmosphere that heady day was nothing out of the ordinary. Warwickshire\u2019s home may have changed over time \u2013 moving from traditional English cricket ground towards the stadium end of the spectrum in 2011 with its multistorey pavilion end and looming \u201ce\u201d floodlights \u2013 but if anything this has simply amplified an already raucous character. Add the fact that England\u2019s men have claimed victory in their past 11 internationals there and it is little wonder Ian Bell, the five-times Ashes winner and lifelong Bear, feels his home ground would be talked up like one of Australia\u2019s strongholds if we were not so English about these things. \u201cThe atmosphere is intimidating for opposition players and that\u2019s probably something we don\u2019t talk enough about in England,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a Gabba-style cauldron \u2013 Edgbaston is our equivalent. The Aussies love starting a series in Brisbane and, as a touring side, if you don\u2019t perform you simply can\u2019t live with them there. Edgbaston has that same dynamic for us. \u201cIt\u2019s the one ground where Australia know they will get stick \u2013 a place where you have to be able to laugh it off or you are in for a seriously tough time.\u201d England, while slightly vexed by their batting during the victory against Ireland at Lord\u2019s last week and still coming down from their World Cup high, will be comforted by the fact the Ashes start here. They love the facilities (not least the football pitch on the Colts Ground) and conditions have tended to suit their strengths. What sets Edgbaston apart, however, is the volume. As Graeme Swann once remarked: \u201cIt\u2019s the closest you get as a cricketer to knowing what it\u2019s like to be a professional footballer.\u201d While limited-overs games can descend into mass karaoke \u2013 the World Cup matches transcended this, not least the cacophonous group game between Pakistan and New Zealand \u2013 Test cricket requires none of the gimmickry. The bars are plentiful but home\u2011side inspiration is the only real ingredient required, such as Jimmy Anderson\u2019s series-changing spell in 2015 or Graham Onions taking two in two balls during the draw in 2009. Writing in the Guardian four years ago, Jason Gillespie said the atmosphere for day one of the 1997 Ashes Test \u201cwas like no other cricket I had experienced\u201d when Australia were 118 all out before lunch. But Bell, still on the mend from a torn ligament in his foot and hoping to resume his county season soon, fancies Edgbaston to have been at its loudest on the Saturday of the 2005 Ashes Test, specifically Andrew Flintoff\u2019s famous over to Ricky Ponting which he observed from short-leg. Bell said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I was new to the side but I just couldn\u2019t believe the noise. But even when the game is in a quiet period, there\u2019s always something going on in the Eric Hollies Stand. It\u2019s probably the only ground in the world where you\u2019ll look into the crowd and suddenly spot Spider\u2011Man climbing a pillar.\u201d The Eric Hollies Stand, named after the leg-spinner whose googly denied Don Bradman a three\u2011figure Test average, will once again be a factor; rebuilt in 2003, its collection of fancy-dressed revellers and amateur comedians are always ready either to pounce on Australian misfortune or perhaps attempt to induce it. For Dennis Amiss, another Warwickshire great who sampled the Gabba\u2019s white heat in 1974-75 when Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson delivered one of their most hostile spells, the Hollies is about gamesmanship and banter rather than anything more sinister. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a partisan crowd but they participate more than ever now \u2013 if they spot an opportunity to have a pop, they take it,\u201d Amiss said. \u201cMy favourite example was seeing an Australian fielder walking backwards towards the boundary rope and suddenly the Hollies started to \u2018Beep, Beep, Beep\u2019 like he was a lorry reversing.\u201d While the atmosphere will likely be in a similar vein this week \u2013 loud, pro-England and with some words for the visitors \u2013 boos for David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft (if selected) are pretty much a given too, even if some 16 months have passed since the sandpaper scandal. Whatever Joe Root says on the subject during the pre-match press conference on Wednesday \u2013 and Eoin Morgan\u2019s roundabout instructions during the World Cup were essentially \u201clet \u2019em have it\u201d \u2013 it is likely coming once more. Bell said: \u201cThey\u2019ll cop it but I don\u2019t think it will affect them. Warner and Smith are world-class players, not just because of technique but through their temperament. I worked with their coach, Justin Langer, at Perth Scorchers and he creates strong team environments, one where they will go out there knowing they have the full backing of their teammates too.\u201d Amiss said: \u201cThey booed them in the World Cup semi-final and so it will probably happen again. But I believe it will be banter, not nastiness. And don\u2019t forget the Aussies are tough people. They could well be spurred on rather than put off.\u201d The pair are probably right but that will not stop Edgbaston from trying.",

She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>'Irresponsible children'</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: \u201cSome people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. \u201cIt proves you are never too small to make a difference,\u201d she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Family</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger\u2019s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Owned by a German property developer, Gerhard Senft, based in Brittany and sponsored by the Yacht Club de Monaco, the 18-metre (60ft) yacht is a high-speed planing monohull built for the 2016-17 single-handed, non-stop round-the-world Vend\u00e9e Globe race. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/teammalizia/posts/2333391836756095?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDm-PG19HwzNIEA_bEwTEMyBNAIKrchxMLBkpuxjLH7R5ISgUaEUobn4TfhXo_NoGkiqISibFjcGdcdR72nSaC2xwtN1v088mICKwXNaIBoy3g0-5eEA2DIwDvUOzIetRzYTGhCdj9lWDxChtiMQpNq0_swRg1A46OOOty1p7ZjZMydmAehBYtOiG5EG13twW23jJ_Ca8I6xyt-4Rknnh7K55896TlatHix5PABGy3gnAgrb8_OsG5g8AQRWYHoyRbRxuogXAxrREP3lX6CL67AySvKppBNAzacDRjcHzdshU3acBehIvDID9iZEpFjL4p69bNNkicgIIgeBcujaPu4g0H-r5Nlmm9LaD-iFWdu9CZ8L1i1XmUhx4Cuo9B3pGVHU4nmjMKAK1x3zD5nuJeNRbdpE2tfhiBnNPMKZSP7vMHEgwLVhixKXW5fEOgo4uiJz2ivsNQeswsBxAUQ6tSE6wc3-3vnmMyDlJXVfGzNU9IGoFZQ9oJ44g&amp;__tn__=-R\">The club said on its Facebook page</a> it was \u201chonoured to be able to sail Greta Thunberg emission-free over the Atlantic\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea874f6b6bb3de8bb754ad32b47586db6bf1cff2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea874f6b6bb3de8bb754ad32b47586db6bf1cff2/0_0_5184_3888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Malizia in Saint-Tropez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Malizia in Saint-Tropez</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arnold Jerocki/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The yacht is fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate zero-carbon electricity.

Plymouth are beneficiaries of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/25/efl-warns-bury-league-one-fixtures-could-be-suspended\" title=\"\">Bury\u2019s financial troubles</a>, gutting last season\u2019s runners-up by re-homing five of their players, as well as manager Ryan Lowe and his backroom staff. \u201cI feel a little bit of guilt about it, but we paid good compensation for them,\u201d said the Plymouth chairman, Simon Hallett. \u201cThe club [Bury] and its executives got itself into this mess, the players aren\u2019t getting paid and they are young men who need income.\u201d Lowe has also recruited fellow Liverpudlian Jose Baxter, who started his career at Everton and returned from a drugs ban last season, on a short-term contract.</p> <p>After spectacularly stalling at the tail-end of last season, <strong>Mansfield Town</strong> will fancy their chances of going one better, with Nicky Maynard, who averaged a goal every 140 minutes at Bury last season, a superb free transfer, though <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOODR4LdcnA\" title=\"\">the video that accompanied confirmation of his arrival</a> made excruciating viewing. <strong>Bradford City</strong>, too, should be in the mix under Gary Bowyer; the former Everton striker James Vaughan, who has been given the captain\u2019s armband, and Clayton Donaldson will cause defences problems, but it was picking the ball out of their own net that was a recurring theme last season.</p> <h2>Play-off contenders</h2> <p>Mark Cooper\u2019s <strong>Forest Green Rovers</strong> almost snuck into the automatic places in May and, despite losing in the play-off semi-finals, they will expect to go close once more having made huge strides in three years under Cooper. Losing Christian Doidge and Reece Brown was a big yet unsurprising blow and Rovers have recruited smartly, with Matt Mills, formerly of Nottingham Forest, joining his younger brother Joseph at the club. Up the M5, it would be a surprise if a new-look <strong>Walsall</strong> were not in the reckoning under Darrell Clarke, while Richie Wellens can send <strong>Swindon</strong> close in his first full season; Zeki Fryers, formerly of Manchester United, is an eye-catching signing.</p> <p><strong>Exeter City</strong> will be expected to challenge after falling short last season and Matt Taylor has freshened up his squad with nine new faces, including the former Reading goalkeeper Lewis Ward and forward Nicky Ajose. Mike Flynn worked wonders to guide <strong>Newport County</strong> into the play-offs on the back of another fine FA Cup run last season but repeating that feat looks a tall order.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6feaf00d1f824570d76a12f4fd2c6e3824eaccfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6feaf00d1f824570d76a12f4fd2c6e3824eaccfb/0_0_3300_2264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exeter, in action here in yellow against Swansea, will be expected to challenge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exeter, in action here in yellow against Swansea, will be expected to challenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Fairweather/Huw Evans/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Salford City</strong> have grand plans but a fifth promotion in six seasons may prove too big an ask. The former Burnley defender Graham Alexander continues to be handsomely backed by the Singaporean billionaire Peter Lim and the \u2018Class of 92\u2019, with Richie Towell, who featured for Rotherham in the Championship last season, an eye-catching signing from Brighton, but whether they can topple the top seven remains to be seen. <strong>Stevenage</strong> could be dark horses under Dino Maamria, if they can start where they left off last season. If new signings gel with a youthful group \u2013 Luther Wildin, 21, and Arthur Iontton, 18, have shone \u2013 they could shake things up. The arrival of Jason Cowley is intriguing, with the striker signing from non-league Bromsgrove Sporting, for whom he scored 102 goals in 127 appearances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Relegation candidates</h2> <p>Thirteen successive seasons at this level is not to be sniffed at but <strong>Morecambe</strong> begin, as they do every season, up against it. By now, though, Jim Bentley, the longest-serving manager in the country at eight years and 78 days and counting, is used to the battle. Kevin Ellison will play on past his 41st birthday but Andy Fleming has been forced to retire aged 31, because of a serious knee injury. \u201cHe was the only outfield player still at the club since I played,\u201d said Bentley, who has signed defender Tom Brewitt, who came through the youth ranks alongside close friend Harry Wilson at Liverpool.</p> <p>Laurent Banide worked with a baby-faced David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry at Monaco but after almost a decade working in the Far East, he becomes the 12th manager in four years at <strong>Oldham Athletic</strong>, where he has said<strong> </strong>his role does not include recruiting players. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/14/paul-scholes-resigns-oldham-manager\" title=\"\">Paul Scholes lasted just 31 days </a>and after another summer of sea change \u2013 including eight signings \u2013 it is impossible to predict the outcome of their latest experiment. Elsewhere, financial unrest still plagues Sol Campbell\u2019s <strong>Macclesfield Town</strong>, while Gabriele Cioffi\u2019s<strong> Crawley Town</strong> have work to do.</p> <h2>Three players to watch</h2> <p><strong>Danny Mayor, Plymouth Argyle</strong></p> <p>Ryan Lowe endeared himself to supporters by bullishly telling them he has signed the \u201cbest No 10 in the league\u201d in Mayor, insisting the former Bury midfielder, who won the League Two player of the year award last season, is better than Graham Carey and Ruben Lameiras, two former Devon darlings. A versatile winger, Mayor, like Lowe, is gunning for successive promotions.</p> <p><strong>Danny Guthrie, Walsall</strong></p> <p>After a stint in Indonesia, the former Liverpool and Newcastle midfielder, who was born in Shrewsbury, has returned closer to home following a trial. The 32-year-old, who made more than 100 Premier League appearances, last played in England for Blackburn. \u201cYou need a good balance in League Two, plenty of energy and a bit of know-how,\u201d said manager Darrell Clarke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e63fddad085150c60a7f52de047a164bacb906a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e63fddad085150c60a7f52de047a164bacb906a/0_242_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Guthrie has signed for Walsall after a trial, having spent time in Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Guthrie has signed for Walsall after a trial, having spent time in Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walsall FC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Aaron Collins, Forest Green Rovers</strong></p> <p>The striker went from McDonald\u2019s to Molineux in less than two years, earning a move to Wolves after impressing at Newport as a teenager but following his release in January, the 22-year-old had to rebuild his confidence.

After spectacularly stalling at the tail-end of last season, Mansfield Town will fancy their chances of going one better, with Nicky Maynard, who averaged a goal every 140 minutes at Bury last season, a superb free transfer, though the video that accompanied confirmation of his arrival made excruciating viewing. Bradford City, too, should be in the mix under Gary Bowyer; the former Everton striker James Vaughan, who has been given the captain\u2019s armband, and Clayton Donaldson will cause defences problems, but it was picking the ball out of their own net that was a recurring theme last season. Play-off contenders Mark Cooper\u2019s Forest Green Rovers almost snuck into the automatic places in May and, despite losing in the play-off semi-finals, they will expect to go close once more having made huge strides in three years under Cooper. Losing Christian Doidge and Reece Brown was a big yet unsurprising blow and Rovers have recruited smartly, with Matt Mills, formerly of Nottingham Forest, joining his younger brother Joseph at the club. Up the M5, it would be a surprise if a new-look Walsall were not in the reckoning under Darrell Clarke, while Richie Wellens can send Swindon close in his first full season; Zeki Fryers, formerly of Manchester United, is an eye-catching signing. Exeter City will be expected to challenge after falling short last season and Matt Taylor has freshened up his squad with nine new faces, including the former Reading goalkeeper Lewis Ward and forward Nicky Ajose. Mike Flynn worked wonders to guide Newport County into the play-offs on the back of another fine FA Cup run last season but repeating that feat looks a tall order. Salford City have grand plans but a fifth promotion in six seasons may prove too big an ask. The former Burnley defender Graham Alexander continues to be handsomely backed by the Singaporean billionaire Peter Lim and the \u2018Class of 92\u2019, with Richie Towell, who featured for Rotherham in the Championship last season, an eye-catching signing from Brighton, but whether they can topple the top seven remains to be seen. Stevenage could be dark horses under Dino Maamria, if they can start where they left off last season. If new signings gel with a youthful group \u2013 Luther Wildin, 21, and Arthur Iontton, 18, have shone \u2013 they could shake things up. The arrival of Jason Cowley is intriguing, with the striker signing from non-league Bromsgrove Sporting, for whom he scored 102 goals in 127 appearances. Relegation candidates Thirteen successive seasons at this level is not to be sniffed at but Morecambe begin, as they do every season, up against it. By now, though, Jim Bentley, the longest-serving manager in the country at eight years and 78 days and counting, is used to the battle. Kevin Ellison will play on past his 41st birthday but Andy Fleming has been forced to retire aged 31, because of a serious knee injury. \u201cHe was the only outfield player still at the club since I played,\u201d said Bentley, who has signed defender Tom Brewitt, who came through the youth ranks alongside close friend Harry Wilson at Liverpool. Laurent Banide worked with a baby-faced David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry at Monaco but after almost a decade working in the Far East, he becomes the 12th manager in four years at Oldham Athletic, where he has said his role does not include recruiting players. Paul Scholes lasted just 31 days and after another summer of sea change \u2013 including eight signings \u2013 it is impossible to predict the outcome of their latest experiment. Elsewhere, financial unrest still plagues Sol Campbell\u2019s Macclesfield Town, while Gabriele Cioffi\u2019s Crawley Town have work to do. Three players to watch Danny Mayor, Plymouth Argyle Ryan Lowe endeared himself to supporters by bullishly telling them he has signed the \u201cbest No 10 in the league\u201d in Mayor, insisting the former Bury midfielder, who won the League Two player of the year award last season, is better than Graham Carey and Ruben Lameiras, two former Devon darlings. A versatile winger, Mayor, like Lowe, is gunning for successive promotions. Danny Guthrie, Walsall After a stint in Indonesia, the former Liverpool and Newcastle midfielder, who was born in Shrewsbury, has returned closer to home following a trial. The 32-year-old, who made more than 100 Premier League appearances, last played in England for Blackburn. \u201cYou need a good balance in League Two, plenty of energy and a bit of know-how,\u201d said manager Darrell Clarke. Aaron Collins, Forest Green Rovers The striker went from McDonald\u2019s to Molineux in less than two years, earning a move to Wolves after impressing at Newport as a teenager but following his release in January, the 22-year-old had to rebuild his confidence. Collins impressed at Morecambe, scoring eight goals in 15 games to earn a summer move to a side serious about chasing promotion under Mark Cooper.",

(How he polices oral communication is unknown. One thing I would say: it\u2019s probably best to avoid asking him where the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3341392/Etiquette-expert-reveals-lavatory-says-social-standing.html\">toilet</a> is.)</p> <p>We all have style preferences, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with expressing them \u2013 as long as you don\u2019t claim they\u2019re the only \u201ccorrect\u201d way of doing things. But the words and phrases Rees-Mogg has singled out are revealing, if not exactly surprising.</p> <h2>Esq.</h2> <p>Among his recommendations, Rees-Mogg asks that \u201call non-titled males\u201d are given the abbreviation Esq., for esquire, after their name. Esquire is a pretty outmoded honorific that technically designates a man below the rank of a knight. It <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/esquire\">derives</a> from the Latin <em>scutarius</em>, meaning \u201cshield bearer\u201d, and entered English via the Old French <em>es</em><em>cuier</em>. There\u2019s almost something egalitarian about the fact that Rees-Mogg wants everyone to get a whiff of aristocracy, even if they don\u2019t have a dukedom or whatnot. But then you remember that there is, of course, no female equivalent.</p> <h2>Hopefully</h2> <p>And now for the banned words. Since the 17th century \u201chopefully\u201d has been used as an adverb, modifying a verb to suggest that the action is done \u201cin a hopeful way\u201d. For example, you might say: \u201cHe asked for some more food, hopefully.\u201d Since roughly the second half of the 20th century more and more people have used it to modify whole sentences, to mean \u201cit is hoped that\u201d. So, \u201chopefully it won\u2019t rain tomorrow\u201d (though there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/455670\">evidence</a> that this goes back to at least the 18th century). In any case, it\u2019s now completely normal. Rees-Mogg is evidently one of those who detests this hopefully as a hideous innovation. But the fact he doesn\u2019t specify that it\u2019s <em>sentential</em> \u201chopefully\u201d he\u2019s worried about shows he already recognises it is the standard usage. As elsewhere, the world has moved on but he hasn\u2019t.</p> <h2>Equal</h2> <p>This is a bit mystifying, as it\u2019s not a word generally disparaged in old-fashioned style guides. Could it be that Rees-Mogg sees it as redolent of various politically correct catchphrases, like equal opportunities, equal rights or (probably his biggest bugbear) equal marriage, which he voted <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/24926/jacob_rees-mogg/north_east_somerset/divisions?policy=826\">against</a> on seven separate occasions?</p> <h2>Got</h2> <p>There are a couple of ways of indicating possession in English, namely \u201chave\u201d and \u201chave got\u201d: \u201cI have a cat\u201d vs \u201cI\u2019ve got a cat\u201d. The latter is usually judged to be slightly less formal, which is presumably why Rees-Mogg hates it. But the ban appears to be a blanket one: got is cast out even where it\u2019s just the past tense of the innocent verb get (as in \u201che got me a present\u201d). This is strange, since get, as the linguist John McWhorter pointed out in a recent episode of his <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/john-mcwhorter-whorfian-hypothesis.html\">podcast</a>, is a hugely important part of the lexical scaffolding of English. Does Rees-Mogg feel it\u2019s been contaminated by association with the informal \u201chave got\u201d construction? Does it just sound a bit too \u201ccommon\u201d?</p> <h2>Meet with</h2> <p>The usual objection to \u201cmeet with\u201d is that the preposition is redundant. \u201cI met with Juncker\u201d and \u201cI met Juncker\u201d, is it argued, mean the same thing, so it\u2019s foolish to add the \u201cwith\u201d (god help you if you say \u201cmet up with\u201d).

Before the tuma is cooked, more milk and rennet are added to the whey, and it is recooked or reheated, and soft white clots, given the same name as the process, <em>ricotta</em>, come to the surface.

      "body": "<p>This weekend the best <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/07/fortnite-battle-royale-parents-guide-video-game-multiplayer-shooter\">Fortnite</a> players in the world gathered at Flushing Meadows in New York to compete in the game\u2019s first ever World Cup Finals for $30m (\u00a324m) in prize money. Tens of thousands of spectators packed the famed Arthur Ashe stadium to watch the action live, and many millions more viewed on Twitch and YouTube. Fortnite is, after all, one of the biggest entertainment brands on the planet, played by hundreds of millions. Amid all the hype and fanfare around the finals, however, one depressing fact remained unavoidable: not a single one of the 100 finalists was female.</p> \n<p>Despite the growing popularity of professional gaming throughout the world \u2013 the audience figures for competitive gaming have reached 450m this year \u2013 female competitors remain scarce. There certainly are high-profile examples of female pros \u2013 trans woman Sasha \u201cScarlett\u201d Hostyn is one of the most successful Starcraft II players in the world; Katherine \u201cMystik\u201d Gunn is the industry\u2019s highest-paid female pro gamer and won the SyFy channel\u2019s reality TV show WCG Ultimate Gamer; and Fortnite has stars such as One_Shot_Gurl and Loeya. But you could watch a year of big tournaments, whether it\u2019s Call of Duty, League of Legends or Hearthstone, and count the number of female competitors on the fingers of one hand.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If things are to improve, the onus is on the game publishers, event organisers, big-name sponsors and team owners</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>This isn\u2019t because women and girls aren\u2019t playing games. The <a href=\"https://www.theesa.com/esa-research/2019-essential-facts-about-the-computer-and-video-game-industry/\">latest figures from the Entertainment Software Association</a> show that 46% of gamers are women \u2013 a figure reflected in several other recent studies. The female audience for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/esports\">esports</a> is also growing: <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2019/meet-the-female-esports-fan/\">figures collected by Nielsen</a> suggest that almost a quarter of the pro gaming audience is female, and in some parts of the world it\u2019s much higher. So why aren\u2019t we seeing that reflected in the Fortnite World Cup?</p> \n<p>The easy answer is because no women qualified. The heats were entirely open and held online over 10 weeks \u2013 more than 40m players competed with no restrictions on age or gender. The pro gaming scene likes to present itself as a meritocracy, where pure talent is all that matters.</p> \n<p>This may be true in terms of the abstract qualifying rules, but the real issue goes deeper and its about why women are under-represented across the esports spectrum.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"12da897b-2587-4cf0-a974-48466c48a579\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Fortnite: Battle Royale</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In short, it's a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a flying bus on to a small island and then fight until only one is left. Hidden around are weapons and traps, and players must arm themselves while exploring.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When was it released?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Fortnite started in July 2017 as a four-player cooperative survival game, but the game's developer, Epic, noticed the huge success of PC title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which pits 100 players against each other, and decided to release a new version.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The game is free and players are able to unlock new items as they progress without paying anything. A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it so popular with kids?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits.

      "bodyText": "This weekend the best Fortnite players in the world gathered at Flushing Meadows in New York to compete in the game\u2019s first ever World Cup Finals for $30m (\u00a324m) in prize money. Tens of thousands of spectators packed the famed Arthur Ashe stadium to watch the action live, and many millions more viewed on Twitch and YouTube. Fortnite is, after all, one of the biggest entertainment brands on the planet, played by hundreds of millions. Amid all the hype and fanfare around the finals, however, one depressing fact remained unavoidable: not a single one of the 100 finalists was female. Despite the growing popularity of professional gaming throughout the world \u2013 the audience figures for competitive gaming have reached 450m this year \u2013 female competitors remain scarce. There certainly are high-profile examples of female pros \u2013 trans woman Sasha \u201cScarlett\u201d Hostyn is one of the most successful Starcraft II players in the world; Katherine \u201cMystik\u201d Gunn is the industry\u2019s highest-paid female pro gamer and won the SyFy channel\u2019s reality TV show WCG Ultimate Gamer; and Fortnite has stars such as One_Shot_Gurl and Loeya. But you could watch a year of big tournaments, whether it\u2019s Call of Duty, League of Legends or Hearthstone, and count the number of female competitors on the fingers of one hand. This isn\u2019t because women and girls aren\u2019t playing games. The latest figures from the Entertainment Software Association show that 46% of gamers are women \u2013 a figure reflected in several other recent studies. The female audience for esports is also growing: figures collected by Nielsen suggest that almost a quarter of the pro gaming audience is female, and in some parts of the world it\u2019s much higher. So why aren\u2019t we seeing that reflected in the Fortnite World Cup? The easy answer is because no women qualified. The heats were entirely open and held online over 10 weeks \u2013 more than 40m players competed with no restrictions on age or gender. The pro gaming scene likes to present itself as a meritocracy, where pure talent is all that matters. This may be true in terms of the abstract qualifying rules, but the real issue goes deeper and its about why women are under-represented across the esports spectrum. Partly it\u2019s down to the culture of \u201chardcore\u201d video game communities, which are overwhelmingly dominated by young men and as a consequence, often unwelcoming to women. Trash talk is a standard in most online competitive games, and can often cross over into misogynistic insults. Rare is the female gamer who plays with unrestricted voice chat. Even when they\u2019re simply playing online with a group of strangers, women players are sometimes belittled and objectified, their abilities constantly questioned. Meanwhile, the sponsorship and marketing of events is highly focused on male viewers \u2013 it\u2019s all energy drinks and ads for ridiculously macho gaming joypads, keyboards and mice with names like Viper and Hyperion. When women do compete, they can find themselves under disproportionate and unwelcome scrutiny. In June, a 15-year-old girl entered a tournament in New York based around the Nintendo game Super Smash Bros and promptly beat a top pro player. She was subsequently hounded and bullied online by his fans. Tweeting under her gaming tag, Bocchi, she claimed to be considering leaving the tournament circuit because of the abuse she received.

I felt the hair stand up on my head. It was such an intimate moment that I looked around thinking: \u2018Did anyone see that?\u2019 I spent the entire trip back to the airport thinking: \u2018Oh my God, I think I\u2019m attracted to Kate and I left her in India.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sue headed back to the US and Kate came home to the UK. They messaged each other for a couple of weeks, then started video calling; soon they were talking for several hours a day.</p> <p>In December 2015, Kate flew out to the US. \u201cWe\u2019d already decided that we were going to give it a go at being a couple,\u201d says Sue. When she picked up Kate at the airport, the feeling \u201cwas instant\u201d, she says. Kate adds: \u201cFrom that point on, it was perfect.\u201d </p> <p>They had agreed that airport arrivals was not a suitably memorable place for their first kiss. \u201cSo we walked out to my car hand in hand,\u201d Sue remembers. \u201cAnd then I couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d</p> <p>Kate stayed for nine days, then they began a two-year long-distance relationship, meeting up every eight weeks. When Kate left her job, she spent a couple of months in the US, where they got engaged, then applied for a visa. \u201cAfter two years, I needed to know what was happening,\u201d says Sue. \u201cWe needed to be together or starting the process of getting together, because it was just too hard.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, they were married by one of the women on their motorcycle trip; another friend from the trip was maid of honour, as was Sue\u2019s adult daughter. They are planning lots more motorcycle adventures.</p> <p><em>Want to share your story?

I felt the hair stand up on my head. It was such an intimate moment that I looked around thinking: \u2018Did anyone see that?\u2019 I spent the entire trip back to the airport thinking: \u2018Oh my God, I think I\u2019m attracted to Kate and I left her in India.\u2019\u201d Sue headed back to the US and Kate came home to the UK. They messaged each other for a couple of weeks, then started video calling; soon they were talking for several hours a day. In December 2015, Kate flew out to the US. \u201cWe\u2019d already decided that we were going to give it a go at being a couple,\u201d says Sue. When she picked up Kate at the airport, the feeling \u201cwas instant\u201d, she says. Kate adds: \u201cFrom that point on, it was perfect.\u201d They had agreed that airport arrivals was not a suitably memorable place for their first kiss. \u201cSo we walked out to my car hand in hand,\u201d Sue remembers. \u201cAnd then I couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d Kate stayed for nine days, then they began a two-year long-distance relationship, meeting up every eight weeks. When Kate left her job, she spent a couple of months in the US, where they got engaged, then applied for a visa. \u201cAfter two years, I needed to know what was happening,\u201d says Sue. \u201cWe needed to be together or starting the process of getting together, because it was just too hard.\u201d Last year, they were married by one of the women on their motorcycle trip; another friend from the trip was maid of honour, as was Sue\u2019s adult daughter. They are planning lots more motorcycle adventures. Want to share your story? Tell us a little about you, your partner and how you got together by filling in the form here.",

      "body": "<p>Almost everything <a href=\"http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/messiaen2index.htm\">Olivier Messiaen</a> wrote was intended \u201cto glorify God in all his creation\u201d. But he made that intention explicit in his description of Des Canyons aux \u00c9toiles \u2026, his longest orchestral work, composed in the early 1970s. It was commissioned for the bicentennial of US independence, and inspired by the vast desert landscapes and night skies of the American south-west, and of Utah in particular.</p> <p>Along with the monumental piano cycle Catalogue d\u2019Oiseaux, the 90-minute work is Messiaen\u2019s most ambitious celebration of the natural world (\u201cGod\u2019s creation\u201d, to the devoutly Roman Catholic composer). Birds sing in all 12 movements of Des Canyons, many of them transcribed by the composer himself in the national parks of Utah, though songs from elsewhere in the world \u2013 the Sahara, Australia, Hawaii \u2013 are incorporated. The score was an obvious choice for a Proms season that takes threatened nature as one of its themes, and it got an evening to itself, played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sakari-oramo\">Sakari Oramo</a>, with pianist <a href=\"http://www.nicolashodges.com/\">Nicolas Hodges</a>, horn player Martin Owen and percussionists David Hockings and Alex Neal as the soloists.</p> <p>Unlike some of Messiaen\u2019s works, Des Canyons was not specifically written for a large, resonant performing space, but the Royal Albert Hall acoustic suited it well. The massive diatonic climax that ends the second of the three parts was easily accommodated; silences were tinged with the dying echoes of the tuned percussion; the tangles of wind lines, as in the ecstatic explosion of birdsong in the penultimate movement, were superbly defined.</p> <p>Interstellar Call, the solo-horn movement, which now seems an unlikely precursor to some of the instrumental solos in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/21/karlheinz-stockhausen-kate-molleson-licht-opera-cycle-southbank-centre\">Stockhausen\u2019s Licht cycle</a>, was made into a masterly tour de force by Owen, just as Hodges was fearsomely authoritative in his two solo movements, both of them bird portraits. But under Oramo\u2019s command, it was the variety and virtuoso flair of the orchestral writing that made the biggest impact. There may be moments that recall Messiaen\u2019s earlier works \u2013 Turangal\u00eela, Oiseaux Exotiques, Chronochromie \u2013 but there\u2019s much more that remains thrillingly fresh and unlike anything else he ever wrote. As this performance reminded us, Des Canyons aux \u00c9toiles \u2026 is one of his greatest achievements.</p> <ul> <li><p>Available on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/collection:p07hbtcr/m00074y1\">BBC Sounds</a>. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/proms\">The Proms continue until 14 September</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Almost everything Olivier Messiaen wrote was intended \u201cto glorify God in all his creation\u201d. But he made that intention explicit in his description of Des Canyons aux \u00c9toiles \u2026, his longest orchestral work, composed in the early 1970s. It was commissioned for the bicentennial of US independence, and inspired by the vast desert landscapes and night skies of the American south-west, and of Utah in particular. Along with the monumental piano cycle Catalogue d\u2019Oiseaux, the 90-minute work is Messiaen\u2019s most ambitious celebration of the natural world (\u201cGod\u2019s creation\u201d, to the devoutly Roman Catholic composer). Birds sing in all 12 movements of Des Canyons, many of them transcribed by the composer himself in the national parks of Utah, though songs from elsewhere in the world \u2013 the Sahara, Australia, Hawaii \u2013 are incorporated. The score was an obvious choice for a Proms season that takes threatened nature as one of its themes, and it got an evening to itself, played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sakari Oramo, with pianist Nicolas Hodges, horn player Martin Owen and percussionists David Hockings and Alex Neal as the soloists. Unlike some of Messiaen\u2019s works, Des Canyons was not specifically written for a large, resonant performing space, but the Royal Albert Hall acoustic suited it well. The massive diatonic climax that ends the second of the three parts was easily accommodated; silences were tinged with the dying echoes of the tuned percussion; the tangles of wind lines, as in the ecstatic explosion of birdsong in the penultimate movement, were superbly defined. Interstellar Call, the solo-horn movement, which now seems an unlikely precursor to some of the instrumental solos in Stockhausen\u2019s Licht cycle, was made into a masterly tour de force by Owen, just as Hodges was fearsomely authoritative in his two solo movements, both of them bird portraits. But under Oramo\u2019s command, it was the variety and virtuoso flair of the orchestral writing that made the biggest impact. There may be moments that recall Messiaen\u2019s earlier works \u2013 Turangal\u00eela, Oiseaux Exotiques, Chronochromie \u2013 but there\u2019s much more that remains thrillingly fresh and unlike anything else he ever wrote. As this performance reminded us, Des Canyons aux \u00c9toiles \u2026 is one of his greatest achievements. Available on BBC Sounds. The Proms continue until 14 September.",

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Police kill food festival assailant, with motive still unclear Three people were killed and at least 15 injured when a gunman opened fire at a food festival in northern California on Sunday, before being shot dead by police. The suspect reportedly cut through a fence at the annual Gilroy garlic festival so his rifle would go undetected by the event\u2019s security staff. The Gilroy police chief, Scot Smithee, told reporters officers engaged the suspect within a minute of his opening fire. The man\u2019s motive remains unclear. Second suspect. A second suspect was \u201cinvolved in some way, we just don\u2019t know in what way,\u201d Smithee said at a press conference. Democrats and media respond to more Trump racism Washington spent the weekend once again arguing over Donald Trump\u2019s racism, after the president attacked the African American congressman Elijah Cummings on Twitter and described his majority black Baltimore district as \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d. Democrats, much of the media and the makers of the Baltimore-set drama The Wire responded with outrage, while the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, insisted to Fox News that the remarks had \u201czero to do with race\u201d. NAACP convention. At the annual meeting of the the nation\u2019s oldest and largest civil rights organisation in Detroit last week, 2020 Democrats were urged not to shy away from the subject of Trump\u2019s overt racism, as Lauren Gambino reports. Rodent problem. The president accused Cummings\u2019 district of having a rodent problem, but his own restaurants have been criticised by inspectors for health code violations including live roaches, filth flies and live mice. Dan Coats to depart as director of national intelligence Dan Coats, the director of US national intelligence and one of the few remaining Trump administration officials prepared to contradict the president in public, is to depart next month and be replaced by a Trump loyalist. The president said on Sunday Coats would step down on 15 August, and that he planned to nominate the Texas congressman John Ratcliffe to the role. As the nation\u2019s top intelligence official for two years, Coats often presented findings to the president that contradicted Trump\u2019s policy aims. Internal disagreement. Coats was forced to defend the intelligence community from criticism by the president on issues including North Korea and Russian election interference. Police in Canada move manhunt for teen murder suspects Police in Canada have sent armed officers, helicopters, dogs and drones to search the remote community of York Landing, Manitoba, in pursuit of teenage murder suspects Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18. The fugitives were reportedly spotted scavenging food from a dump by members of the indigenous Bear Clan Patrol. People in York Landing, where the population is less than 450, were warned to stay indoors as the search continued. String of killings. The two young fugitives are suspected of killing the Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, and his American girlfriend Chynna Deese, 24, and have already been charged in the death of a Canadian, 64-year-old Leonard Dyck. Crib sheet The jailed Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been hospitalised with symptoms that one of his doctors said could indicate he had been poisoned. At least 20 people have been killed and 50 injured in a suicide bombing and gun battle at the office of a vice-presidential candidate in Kabul, as Afghanistan gears up for elections amid near-daily attacks by the Taliban and Islamic State. Riot police and protesters have clashed again in Hong Kong during a third straight day of pro-democracy demonstrations, as China\u2019s representative office in the semi-autonomous territory prepared to hold a rare press conference regarding the unrest. Syrian refugees in Beirut and Istanbul are reportedly being rounded up by Lebanese and Turkish immigration authorities respectively, and sent back to still-volatile areas of Syria, raising fears of mass deportations. Must-reads Ken Burns on America: \u2018A strange and complicated people\u2019 Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has told the story of the US through masterful series on subjects including the Civil War, the old West, baseball and Vietnam. As he prepares to unveil his latest, Country Music, Burns tells Mark Lawson why he is \u201cfiercely loyal to facts.\u201d How the climate crisis sparked an exodus to the US Violence, poverty and corruption may have forced millions of Central Americans to flee their homes. But the climate crisis has also brought drought and famine to the region, fuelling an exodus that Americans see only when its victims reach their southern border. Nina Lakhani reports from Guatemala. Can you afford to be green when you\u2019re poor? Politicians and corporations have placed the burden of environmental responsibility on the consumer. But it\u2019s not that easy to be green when you\u2019re barely getting by, as Alison Stine illustrates by keeping a diary of her attempts. What is facial recognition \u2013 and how sinister is it? Facial recognition is already close to ubiquitous, from tagging photos on Facebook to government surveillance, but many people still don\u2019t know what it is, how it works \u2013 and whether to be concerned about its rise. Ian Sample explains the technology and its implications. Opinion When her community resisted the construction of a hydroelectric dam that threatened to contaminate their water, Wendy Garc\u00eda was teargassed and arrested by Honduran police. She explains why she fled with her two-year-old son to seek asylum in the US. In Honduras, money is power, and we, the poor people, don\u2019t have access to justice. Sport Colombia is celebrating its first victory in the Tour de France, after 22-year-old Egan Bernal claimed the yellow jersey on Sunday, winning what his second-placed teammate Geraint Thomas said could be the first of many. Two of Oakland\u2019s celebrated sports franchises, the Warriors and the Raiders, have left or are leaving for new homes. Could a new soccer club, the Oakland Roots, give the city another sport to cheer for, ask Simon Campbell and Max Brimelow.

Jo Swinson is a brilliant force for change. She\u2019s intelligent, articulate and experienced for someone who\u2019s yet to turn 40. She will challenge both Boris Johnson\u2019s bluffing buffoonery and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s hard-left idealism. With her at the helm there is genuine hope for a new liberal movement to rise again in the UK. For a younger woman to strike out and offer a new path to follow will give great success to the party, as it did in New Zealand with Jacinda Ardern and in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

I don\u2019t feel I can vote Labour under Corbyn, so it\u2019s Lib Dem or Green now. Fingers crossed Swinson can start to make me believe again. They need to remain a strong voice for a second referendum, but also ensure they have believable policies in other areas too.

They are the only middle ground party and the only ones committed to electoral reform. I would personally vote Green but the only way to do that effectively is to edge towards PR.

I hope the party will be able to capitalise on the anti-Brexit feeling among large parts of the population and lead through the middle, growing its support base and number of MPs in any future election. I voted for Swinson because she is young, fresh, passionate, intelligent, articulate and speaks with authority on a range of topics.

      "bodyText": "China has offered its full support to Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader and its police force, and said violent protesters must be swiftly punished, in rare remarks by the government office that oversees policy towards the territory. Hong Kong has been rocked by two months of escalating pro-democracy protests that have posed the most significant challenge to Beijing\u2019s authority since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In its first press conference since 1997, the state council\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau affairs office said the protests were \u201chorrendous incidents\u201d that have caused serious damage to the rule of law. \u201cNo civilised society or rule of law society will tolerate rampant violence,\u201d said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office. Yang said the violence, which he blamed on a \u201cfew radicals\u201d, had seriously undermined Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability. \u201cIn our view, the most dangerous situation in Hong Kong is that violent crimes have not been effectively stopped,\u201d he added. \u201cThe most important task of Hong Kong at present is to resolutely punish violent crimes according to law, restore social stability as soon as possible, and safeguard Hong Kong\u2019s good legal system.\u201d The last eight weeks of protests were sparked by a now delayed bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China, but most recently the anger has pivoted towards the police, who have been accused of using excessive force. Protesters have also focused their ire on what many believe to be collusion between the authorities and triads, Hong Kong\u2019s organised crime groups, after masked and armed thugs conducted vicious attacks on metro commuters, protesters and journalists on 21 July. At the press conference on Monday the Hong Kong office said \u201crumours\u201d of police or Chinese involvement in the attacks were \u201cunfounded and insulting\u201d. Echoing statements previously made by state-owned media and other Beijing officials, the spokesman also sharply criticised foreign \u201cinterference\u201d, blaming western politicians for trying to cause trouble in the country. Hours before the briefing on Monday, the People\u2019s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist party, called on the Hong Kong government and police to \u201cnot hesitate\u201d and \u201cdo what needs to be done\u201d to end the weeks of protest. \u201cFor some time, the power of the Hong Kong police has been severely limited by politics, public opinion, and even the judicial environment,\u201d said one editorial, describing protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201cmilitants\u201d who have undermined stability in Hong Kong. \u201cFacing these circumstances the Hong Kong government and police should not have any hesitation or any \u2018psychological burden\u2019 \u2013 do what needs to be done.\u201d The article called on the police to \u201cpunish lawbreakers regardless of whether they hold up the banner of \u2018freedom and democracy\u2019 or wear the cap of \u2018civil disobedience\u2019\u201d. Monday\u2019s remarks by government officials and the party paper are the strongest statements Beijing has made since the mass protests began in June. Observers have been looking for clues as to how Beijing would respond and the possibility of escalation, including deploying the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which has a garrison in Hong Kong. At the briefing, the spokesperson sidestepped a question on potential intervention, saying he had nothing to add to what was already stated in the Basic Law, the city\u2019s constitution. Last week, an official from the Chinese defence ministry said Beijing could legally intervene should the Hong Kong government ask for help \u201cin maintaining social order\u201d. In a front-page article in the overseas edition of the People\u2019s Daily on Monday, the paper also criticised the Civil Human Rights Front, a group in Hong Kong that has organised mass marches against the extradition bill. The paper accused the group of collaborating with \u201cwestern forces\u201d and warned citizens to keep their eyes open to such groups who \u201clead the wolves into your home and hurt the country\u201d. \u201c[China] will never allow any foreign forces to collaborate with the internal forces, endanger Hong Kong\u2019s development, and trample on \u2018one country, two systems\u2019,\u201d the article said. With anger mounting over police violence, including the use of teargas in residential areas over the weekend, there is no end in sight to the mass demonstrations. Protests are scheduled for the next three weeks all over the territory, including a mass transit strike, a rally by civil servants and a city-wide strike. \u201cFor the Chinese Communist party, the continuing crisis in Hong Kong is not only a direct challenge to its authority but also damaging to its domestic prestige and international reputation,\u201d said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Australia. \u201cEssentially, Beijing just doesn\u2019t have any simple short-term answers to the current impasse,\u201d he said. \u201cBeijing\u2019s Hong Kong problem is here to stay.\u201d",

That appears beyond the capacity, or the wish, of the present prime minister. Abrupt departure from Europe\u2019s entire economic community was never put to the referendum. It is not the will of the UK\u2019s now spineless parliament. It became a talisman of internal Tory machismo. It is a sick joke which, in business, would constitute criminal negligence. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

The rapper is currently jailed in Sweden, awaiting trial for an assault charge after footage emerged of him and his entourage allegedly punching and kicking a pair of men on a Stockholm street. According to a written statement by a Secret Service officer, Rebecca Kanter is accused of screaming at embassy staff, accosting a group of students visiting the embassy and damaging property. She was arrested after refusing to leave the premises, and charged with wilfully injuring and damaging property of a foreign government, and refusing to depart a foreign embassy. The previous day she had allegedly thrown liquid from a Coca-Cola bottle at the embassy and shouted: \u201cI\u2019m going to blow this motherfucker up.\u201d She wrote on social media that she had \u201cdefiled the House of Sweden \u2026 why aren\u2019t I getting press for A$AP\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Last night, a US teenager who goes by the name Bugha \u2013 real name Kyle Giersdorf \u2013 became the Fortnite World Cup Champion. The 16-year-old beat 99 other players in the brightly coloured Battle Royale game, running, building and fighting his way to a $3m (\u00a32.4m) victory.</p> \n<p>The competition began months ago, with waves of qualifiers being selected in weekly online play-ins. A total of 40 million people attempted to qualify for the World Cup, the first esports event of its kind for the mega-hit Fortnite, one of the world\u2019s most popular video games. The 100 who made their way to New York this weekend represented 30 different countries.</p> \n<p>Once there, they faced off in six rounds of the game\u2019s last-man standing battles, scoring points for eliminating others or staying alive for as long as possible. A pro player for the esports organisation Sentinels, which fields players in Hearthstone and Apex Legends tournaments as well as Fortnite, Bugha pulled ahead in the very first round, racking up nine eliminations and surviving all the other players.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37d12333ebb5ef6c0e7638337b8cff1d27cf08dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37d12333ebb5ef6c0e7638337b8cff1d27cf08dd/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The final of the Solo competition at the 2019 Fortnite World Cup took place at Flushing Meadows Arthur Ashe stadium in Queens, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The final of the 2019 Fortnite World Cup took place at Arthur Ashe stadium at Flushing Meadows in Queens, New York.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Szenes/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Though his performances in future rounds were less attention-grabbing, his consistency meant that he stayed in first place throughout. In the sixth and final round he stayed alive until the top 10, eventually falling, but already smiling because he knew no one could catch up to his points lead. He ended up with almost double the score of the second-place competitor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"12da897b-2587-4cf0-a974-48466c48a579\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Fortnite: Battle Royale</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In short, it's a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a flying bus on to a small island and then fight until only one is left. Hidden around are weapons and traps, and players must arm themselves while exploring.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When was it released?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Fortnite started in July 2017 as a four-player cooperative survival game, but the game's developer, Epic, noticed the huge success of PC title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which pits 100 players against each other, and decided to release a new version.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The game is free and players are able to unlock new items as they progress without paying anything. A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it so popular with kids?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. Players can pull a variety of dance moves, and team up with a friend to compete as a duo or a squad. Participants can chat as they play using headsets and microphones.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there violence? And is it addictive?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements \u2013 nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers \u2013 into one package that is free to download.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The American competitor described how he was feeling in a post-match interview. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy. Everything I\u2019ve done, the grind, it\u2019s all paid off.\u201d His family was in the stadium to watch and congratulate him. So, too, were approximately 16,000 other attendees, with millions more tuning in online.</p> \n<p>Because each Fortnite match starts out with 100 players, they can be difficult to follow as precisely as more straightforward competitive games. Matches usually begin slowly as players drop on to their favourite spots on the map and gather materials, guns, and stranger additional items like a hamster wheel for quickly travelling around or a shadow bomb that makes you temporarily invisible.</p> \n<p>After a short time, a \u201cstorm\u201d appears on the map, forcing players to move into a more condensed area. As the arena becomes smaller and smaller, the action ramps up, beginning with scraps between two people or small groups, and ending with an all-out brawl with dozens of competitors packed into a tiny space.

      "bodyText": "Last night, a US teenager who goes by the name Bugha \u2013 real name Kyle Giersdorf \u2013 became the Fortnite World Cup Champion. The 16-year-old beat 99 other players in the brightly coloured Battle Royale game, running, building and fighting his way to a $3m (\u00a32.4m) victory. The competition began months ago, with waves of qualifiers being selected in weekly online play-ins. A total of 40 million people attempted to qualify for the World Cup, the first esports event of its kind for the mega-hit Fortnite, one of the world\u2019s most popular video games. The 100 who made their way to New York this weekend represented 30 different countries. Once there, they faced off in six rounds of the game\u2019s last-man standing battles, scoring points for eliminating others or staying alive for as long as possible. A pro player for the esports organisation Sentinels, which fields players in Hearthstone and Apex Legends tournaments as well as Fortnite, Bugha pulled ahead in the very first round, racking up nine eliminations and surviving all the other players. Though his performances in future rounds were less attention-grabbing, his consistency meant that he stayed in first place throughout. In the sixth and final round he stayed alive until the top 10, eventually falling, but already smiling because he knew no one could catch up to his points lead. He ended up with almost double the score of the second-place competitor. The American competitor described how he was feeling in a post-match interview. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy. Everything I\u2019ve done, the grind, it\u2019s all paid off.\u201d His family was in the stadium to watch and congratulate him. So, too, were approximately 16,000 other attendees, with millions more tuning in online. Because each Fortnite match starts out with 100 players, they can be difficult to follow as precisely as more straightforward competitive games. Matches usually begin slowly as players drop on to their favourite spots on the map and gather materials, guns, and stranger additional items like a hamster wheel for quickly travelling around or a shadow bomb that makes you temporarily invisible. After a short time, a \u201cstorm\u201d appears on the map, forcing players to move into a more condensed area. As the arena becomes smaller and smaller, the action ramps up, beginning with scraps between two people or small groups, and ending with an all-out brawl with dozens of competitors packed into a tiny space. When only two players remain, a tense 1:1 battle determines who will get the all-important victory royale. Many viewers of the Fortnite World Cup had favourite players that they supported throughout the tournament. The most popular competitor at the World Cup was likely Turner Ellis Tenney, better known as Tfue, who regularly broadcasts his matches to a dedicated community. Playing Fortnite is already his career, both as a competitive player in tournaments and as a streamer on Twitch, entertaining his fans on a daily basis. But many of the 100 competitors were ordinary teenagers, who practise on their home computers or consoles. Sixteen-year-old Bugha represents the average age of a competitor, while others, including fifth-place finalist Thiago \u201cKing\u201d Lapp from Argentina, were as young as 13. They were competing for a slice of the World Cup\u2019s $30m (\u00a324m) prize pool, currently the biggest in esports history \u2013 and the same amount awarded to teams in the recent women\u2019s football World Cup. One 15-year-old British player, Jaden Ashman, took home over \u00a31m by placing second with his partner in the duos version of the competition on Saturday. He told the BBC that he would probably save half of it and put \u201cquite a lot of it into a house and my family\u201d. His mother admitted that she had been \u201cquite against his gaming\u201d.

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was added to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Joint interpretative instrument&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n    <p>A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

      "bodyText": "Dominic Raab has claimed Britain will be in a better position to negotiate a \u201cgood deal\u201d with the European Union if it crashes out of the bloc before the end of October. The foreign secretary believes a no-deal scenario could provide more leverage in the context of a free trade agreement and resolve long-standing issues such as the Irish backstop. The MP for Esher and Walton in Surrey also suggested the EU\u2019s \u201cstubborn\u201d behaviour would be responsible if the UK left without a deal and refused to endorse Boris Johnson\u2019s claim during his campaign for the Conservative leadership that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was a-million-to-one against. On leaving without a deal after 31 October, Raab told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe prospect of reverting and getting a good deal will be easier after we have left if that is the case. The reason being we do as an independent third country and less subject to effectively the demands of the EU as we are now.\u201d During a hustings event in June, Johnson said the chances of a no-deal Brexit were a \u201cmillion-to-one against\u201d despite repeatedly promising to leave by the deadline. The government has stepped up preparations for such an outcome in recent days. Michael Gove said over the weekend that officials were \u201coperating on the assumption\u201d that a deal would not be struck. Raab insisted the government wanted to strike a deal with the EU and would make renewed efforts to reach out to Brussels in meetings during the summer parliamentary recess. However, he said there \u201cmust be some change from the EU\u201d. \u201cI think what people want to know is the reassurance first of all we are going to deliver Brexit by the end of October \u2013 that is the massive trust issue here, if you want to frame it in those terms. \u201cSecondly, while we want a good deal with our EU friends and partners we must abolish the undemocratic backstop. We will keep straining every sinew if a deal is to be done, but the EU will need to move [its position]. \u201cIf they don\u2019t it is incredibly important we are ready for all eventualities.\u201d The former Brexit secretary added: \u201cWe want a good deal but since the remarks [Johnson made] we have had a series of fairly stubborn positions staked out from the EU. In fairness you would expect that; it\u2019s only a few days into this administration. \u201cIf they stick to that line \u2013 they\u2019re not willing to move at all, they have reaffirmed that \u2013 we must be prepared to give the country the finality it needs, to prepare businesses and people more broadly.\u201d Raab added there was a mandate for a no-deal Brexit and \u201cBrussels isn\u2019t the only game in town\u201d, with opportunities for trade deals with the US, Latin America and Asia. His remarks come after the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday that \u201cmore and more people in Northern Ireland will come to question the union\u201d if the UK crashed out of the EU. Meanwhile, the former Conservative minister Sir Oliver Letwin said Theresa May\u2019s government had not done enough work to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Letwin told the BBC: \u201cI think there should have been considerably more preparation even stretching back a couple of years, but we are where we are and although, as you\u2019ve just said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very sensible for this country to be heading towards a no deal.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I got a little scar, an ulcer, but I thought nothing of it.\u201d Lauren Brimble recalls the mark that appeared on her lower right leg 11 years ago. It seemed routine at the time, but it was the start of Brimble\u2019s long struggle with wounds in different parts of her body. She says through gritted teeth that they are \u201cuncomfortable, ugly and painful\u201d: \u201cThey\u2019re constantly there, and that bothers me.\u201d</p> <p>As she talks, a nurse is tending to her latest wound, on the inside of her left calf. Measuring 6.5cm long and 5.5cm wide, it resembles an orangey-red hole just below the knee: raw, angry and exposed. \u201cIt started off quite small \u2013 I\u2019ve had it for two or three years now,\u201d says Brimble, matter-of-factly.</p> <p>Brimble, a 32-year-old learning coach, is among a fast-growing number of people living with \u201cchronic wounds\u201d: a major and very expensive problem that gets very little media or political attention. They usually take the form of an ulcer on the foot or leg that does not respond to treatment and so does not heal, debilitating those afflicted for months or even years. There are an estimated 2.2 million people living with non-healing wounds in the UK and caring for them costs the NHS upwards of \u00a35bn a year \u2013 roughly what it spends on treating obesity.</p> <p>\u201cHaving a chronic wound is often devastating for patients,\u201d says Dr Una Adderley, NHS England\u2019s expert on wounds. \u201cPeople with chronic wounds experience pain, malodour and leakage, impaired mobility, anxiety, sleep disturbances and social isolation. This has a profound impact on their quality of life.\u201d</p> <p>Wounds are usually caused by an injury or surgery. However, having an underlying illness such as diabetes, problematic vein conditions such as varicose veins or excess pressure in the veins (venous disease), and narrowing of the arteries (arterial disease) increases someone\u2019s risk of developing a wound in the first place and of it then not healing for a long time. <a href=\"http://nhs.stopthepressure.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pressure ulcers</a>, caused by sitting down too long, are another common cause. Adderley says that about 59% of wounds become chronic.</p> <p>The increase in those with the condition is down to rising numbers of older people, and people with diabetes, who are at greater risk of developing a chronic wound; the number of people with one or more chronic wounds is going up accordingly. The relentless rise in obesity is also a factor, adds Adderley. Older age, diabetes and obesity can also interfere with wound healing, as can smoking, infection or poor diet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ae950d5c849f6e76914738676dedd0db46d16c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ae950d5c849f6e76914738676dedd0db46d16c6/0_233_6351_3811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Brimble having her leg wound dressed by a nurse at St Woolos hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren Brimble having her leg wound dressed by a nurse at St Woolos hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brimble\u2019s chronic wounds are the result of health problems that increase her risk of ulceration, including protein C deficiency, which means her blood is more likely to clot, and the resulting chronic venous disease in both legs. This wound is the fifth she has had; each has lasted for many months and needed regular medical care. The effects are practical and psychological, not just physical. \u201cMy wounds are on my mind 90% of the time \u2013 they affect my life in pretty much every way,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are low-grade painful and give me discomfort all the time.\u201d Brimble has had to take a lot of time off work, including one eight-month spell in 2017, when she had to go to hospital three times a week. It is difficult enough as it is to get around: she cannot go swimming, or get her legs wet in the rain \u2013 when they are at their worst, she can\u2019t even walk. \u201cI can\u2019t be spontaneous; I have to plan everything with my wounds in mind,\u201d she says. \u201cWounds aren\u2019t classed as a disability, but I\u2019m more disabled than some people with a blue badge.\u201d</p> <p>Brimble\u2019s wounds also induce panic attacks five or six times a week and she has recently resumed taking antidepressants. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a strong gallows humour about them, but they are incredibly stressful. It\u2019s a battle every day, a full-on slog. The worst thing is that it\u2019s summer, it\u2019s boiling hot, and I\u2019ve got my leg wrapped in bandaging. I can\u2019t wear skirts or dresses; I can only wear trousers.\u201d But, she adds, determinedly: \u201cI\u2019m refusing to let the wounds win.\u201d</p> <p>Brimble is lucky that she receives excellent care when she needs it at the wounds clinic at St Woolos community hospital in Newport in Wales. It is run by Prof Keith Harding, who, in 1991, gave up a career in hospital medicine to become the UK\u2019s first specialist in wounds. \u201cThey are undoubtedly a significant clinical challenge, though aren\u2019t always seen as one,\u201d he says. \u201cThe public thinks of wounds as trivial, minor traumas, like cutting your finger on a piece of paper, sunburn or grazes on knees. In reality, there\u2019s a big diversity of underlying diseases that can cause them. The main obvious effects are pain, suffering and disfigurement, but they have huge effects on individuals.\u201d</p> <p>Another regular visitor to Harding is 65-year-old Ray Freeman, a former panel-beater. He first got wounds on his ankles and lower back from lying in a hospital bed for eight months in 1973 when a car crash left him unable to use his lower limbs; he has used a wheelchair ever since. When those wounds cleared, he was mercifully free of them until 2008, when he slipped in the shower, hitting the ground hard in the process.</p> <p>He began getting sores again, on his bottom and the sides of his feet. Freeman has ischaemia, a form of arterial disease that restricts blood supply. \u201cThat means I can\u2019t wear any footwear, not even slippers,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cBut the biggest of the 10 to 15 sores I\u2019ve had have been on my buttocks, from going to the gym and doing weights exercises \u2013 that made things much worse. The ones on my bottom were huge. They were just big holes in both cheeks \u2013 so big you could put a hand into them.\u201d They were so deep that pieces of bone started peeking out from the holes, because the bone had become diseased \u2013 a side-effect of serious wounds called <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/osteomyelitis/\" title=\"\">osteomyelitis</a>. Freeman\u2019s treatment involved antibiotics and surgery in which skin and muscle from his leg were grafted to repair the wound.</p> <p>Most at risk are people with diabetes. A third of all wounds are caused by foot ulcers brought on by the illness. \u201cInjuries to the feet can quickly become dangerous for people with diabetes if they\u2019ve had difficulty managing their condition for a long time,\u201d says Dan Howarth, a diabetes specialist nurse who is also head of care at the charity Diabetes UK. He explains that that is because increased blood sugars create thick, sticky blood, which can lead to neuropathy (a loss of sensation due to nerve damage) and/or problems with circulation due to damage to the small blood vessels.</p> <p>\u201cProblems with circulation reduce the body\u2019s ability to heal injuries, which is a real problem when someone with diabetes also has a loss of sensation. A minor injury to the foot can go unnoticed, and therefore untreated, which can quickly lead to an ulcer, infection or \u2013 without urgent specialist care \u2013 even amputation.\u201d</p> <p>Some 70,000 to 90,000 <a href=\"https://diabetes-resources-production.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/diabetes-storage/migration/pdf/Diabetic%2520footcare%2520in%2520England%2C%2520An%2520economic%2520case%2520study%2520%28January%25202017%29.pdf\" title=\"\"> diabetics in England have a foot ulcer</a> at any one time; it is sobering that, in England, diabetes leads to more than 9,000 leg, toe or foot amputations a year, and a diabetic is 20 times more likely to experience an amputation than someone without diabetes. \u201cWounds have consequences,\u201d says Harding. Diabetics with a wound or ulcer on their foot have almost a 50% chance of being dead within five years \u2013 far higher than for breast (18%) or prostate (8%) cancers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe52bc7592defcad47ffe81d77d51cc3073599a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe52bc7592defcad47ffe81d77d51cc3073599a5/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Woolos\u2019 clinical research director, Nichola Ivins, with Prof Harding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Woolos\u2019 clinical research director, Nichola Ivins, with Prof Harding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet despite the serious impact of wounds and their frequency, the NHS is not especially effective at treating them. \u201cAlthough wounds are very common and very expensive for the NHS, they are poorly managed in the vast majority of cases,\u201d says Harding. \u201cMany patients are frustrated at their inability to access clinical staff who have expertise in this area, which often means that their wounds go on troubling them, sometimes avoidably, for years and years and years.\u201d</p> <p>Adderley, who has drawn up NHS England\u2019s <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">national wound care strategy</a>, admits that \u201csuboptimal wound care leading to non-healing or delayed healing increases the number of people living with chronic wounds. Too many people are receiving care for which there is little evidence that it works and too few are receiving care for which there is strong evidence that it works.\u201d</p> <p>The death of John Pearce shows the tragic potential consequences. The 90-year-old, who lived alone and was confined to his bed, developed a wound to his left knee after a fall at his home in Gospel Oak, north London, last year. But poor care, especially from the district nurses who visited him, meant it grew to 7cm deep, so deep that it left his tendon and bone exposed. It got infected and he died as a direct result of a wound that, with proper attention, would have been treatable.</p> <p>The coroner who presided over the inquest into his death was so appalled at the evidence presented of Pearce\u2019s poor care and an inexplicable failure to take him to hospital sooner that he took the unusual step of issuing <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/publications/john-pearce/\" title=\"\">a Prevention of Future Deaths report </a> to Central and North West London (CNWL) NHS trust, nurses from which had visited him. \u201cIt is clear staff were following a tissue viability nurse care pan, but no one appeared to recognise the severity of the injury and the fact that tendons and bone were exposed,\u201d wrote Edwin Buckett, the assistant coroner for north London. There were also \u201cinsufficient attendances\u201d by the district nurses. If Pearce had been admitted to hospital sooner, as he should have been, then he would have lived, he added. Last month, <a href=\"http://camdennewjournal.com/article/nhs-chiefs-apologise-after-90-year-old-man-dies-from-untreated-sores\" title=\"\">CNWL heads apologised</a>, saying that Pearce\u2019s death was deeply regretted and measures had been put in place to prevent it from happening again.</p> <p>Last week, the veteran Labour MP Ann Clwyd left her bed in St Thomas\u2019 hospital opposite parliament, where she was being treated for a foot ulcer, to lead an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on \u201cprovision of lower limb care\u201d. Like Harding and Adderley, she is concerned that NHS care of people with wounds is too often not good enough, with patients subject to a postcode lottery in the availability of specialist teams to support them.</p> <p>Doctors who specialise in wounds want everyone involved \u2013 government, the health service \u2013 to do much more. \u201cWounds generally are neglected by everybody: the medical community, NHS, governments, hospital managers and even society, which mistakenly seems to think they\u2019re part of the ageing process,\u201d says Harding. And it cannot be down to those who are living with wounds to lead the charge. \u201cPatients are embarrassed by their wounds and weakened by the pain and sleep deprivation that come from living with a wound,\u201d says Adderley.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t like to make a fuss, but this situation cannot go on. Patients deserve better.\u201d</p>",

It is run by Prof Keith Harding, who, in 1991, gave up a career in hospital medicine to become the UK\u2019s first specialist in wounds. \u201cThey are undoubtedly a significant clinical challenge, though aren\u2019t always seen as one,\u201d he says. \u201cThe public thinks of wounds as trivial, minor traumas, like cutting your finger on a piece of paper, sunburn or grazes on knees. In reality, there\u2019s a big diversity of underlying diseases that can cause them. The main obvious effects are pain, suffering and disfigurement, but they have huge effects on individuals.\u201d Another regular visitor to Harding is 65-year-old Ray Freeman, a former panel-beater. He first got wounds on his ankles and lower back from lying in a hospital bed for eight months in 1973 when a car crash left him unable to use his lower limbs; he has used a wheelchair ever since. When those wounds cleared, he was mercifully free of them until 2008, when he slipped in the shower, hitting the ground hard in the process. He began getting sores again, on his bottom and the sides of his feet. Freeman has ischaemia, a form of arterial disease that restricts blood supply. \u201cThat means I can\u2019t wear any footwear, not even slippers,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cBut the biggest of the 10 to 15 sores I\u2019ve had have been on my buttocks, from going to the gym and doing weights exercises \u2013 that made things much worse. The ones on my bottom were huge. They were just big holes in both cheeks \u2013 so big you could put a hand into them.\u201d They were so deep that pieces of bone started peeking out from the holes, because the bone had become diseased \u2013 a side-effect of serious wounds called osteomyelitis. Freeman\u2019s treatment involved antibiotics and surgery in which skin and muscle from his leg were grafted to repair the wound. Most at risk are people with diabetes. A third of all wounds are caused by foot ulcers brought on by the illness. \u201cInjuries to the feet can quickly become dangerous for people with diabetes if they\u2019ve had difficulty managing their condition for a long time,\u201d says Dan Howarth, a diabetes specialist nurse who is also head of care at the charity Diabetes UK. He explains that that is because increased blood sugars create thick, sticky blood, which can lead to neuropathy (a loss of sensation due to nerve damage) and/or problems with circulation due to damage to the small blood vessels. \u201cProblems with circulation reduce the body\u2019s ability to heal injuries, which is a real problem when someone with diabetes also has a loss of sensation. A minor injury to the foot can go unnoticed, and therefore untreated, which can quickly lead to an ulcer, infection or \u2013 without urgent specialist care \u2013 even amputation.\u201d Some 70,000 to 90,000 diabetics in England have a foot ulcer at any one time; it is sobering that, in England, diabetes leads to more than 9,000 leg, toe or foot amputations a year, and a diabetic is 20 times more likely to experience an amputation than someone without diabetes. \u201cWounds have consequences,\u201d says Harding. Diabetics with a wound or ulcer on their foot have almost a 50% chance of being dead within five years \u2013 far higher than for breast (18%) or prostate (8%) cancers. Yet despite the serious impact of wounds and their frequency, the NHS is not especially effective at treating them. \u201cAlthough wounds are very common and very expensive for the NHS, they are poorly managed in the vast majority of cases,\u201d says Harding. \u201cMany patients are frustrated at their inability to access clinical staff who have expertise in this area, which often means that their wounds go on troubling them, sometimes avoidably, for years and years and years.\u201d Adderley, who has drawn up NHS England\u2019s national wound care strategy, admits that \u201csuboptimal wound care leading to non-healing or delayed healing increases the number of people living with chronic wounds. Too many people are receiving care for which there is little evidence that it works and too few are receiving care for which there is strong evidence that it works.\u201d The death of John Pearce shows the tragic potential consequences. The 90-year-old, who lived alone and was confined to his bed, developed a wound to his left knee after a fall at his home in Gospel Oak, north London, last year. But poor care, especially from the district nurses who visited him, meant it grew to 7cm deep, so deep that it left his tendon and bone exposed. It got infected and he died as a direct result of a wound that, with proper attention, would have been treatable. The coroner who presided over the inquest into his death was so appalled at the evidence presented of Pearce\u2019s poor care and an inexplicable failure to take him to hospital sooner that he took the unusual step of issuing a Prevention of Future Deaths report to Central and North West London (CNWL) NHS trust, nurses from which had visited him. \u201cIt is clear staff were following a tissue viability nurse care pan, but no one appeared to recognise the severity of the injury and the fact that tendons and bone were exposed,\u201d wrote Edwin Buckett, the assistant coroner for north London. There were also \u201cinsufficient attendances\u201d by the district nurses. If Pearce had been admitted to hospital sooner, as he should have been, then he would have lived, he added. Last month, CNWL heads apologised, saying that Pearce\u2019s death was deeply regretted and measures had been put in place to prevent it from happening again. Last week, the veteran Labour MP Ann Clwyd left her bed in St Thomas\u2019 hospital opposite parliament, where she was being treated for a foot ulcer, to lead an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on \u201cprovision of lower limb care\u201d. Like Harding and Adderley, she is concerned that NHS care of people with wounds is too often not good enough, with patients subject to a postcode lottery in the availability of specialist teams to support them. Doctors who specialise in wounds want everyone involved \u2013 government, the health service \u2013 to do much more. \u201cWounds generally are neglected by everybody: the medical community, NHS, governments, hospital managers and even society, which mistakenly seems to think they\u2019re part of the ageing process,\u201d says Harding. And it cannot be down to those who are living with wounds to lead the charge. \u201cPatients are embarrassed by their wounds and weakened by the pain and sleep deprivation that come from living with a wound,\u201d says Adderley. \u201cThey don\u2019t like to make a fuss, but this situation cannot go on. Patients deserve better.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A clique of radical extremists have seized the levers of power. A risky event that was unthinkable three years ago now seems unstoppable. Those with experience and acknowledged expertise have been marginalised. Dissent is discouraged. Sensible people are sceptical, uneasy. Lesser officials suppress their doubts and keep working within the system, hoping the leaders are right and that the damage will be less than they fear. They block out fears of ruin and look forward to promised cash. But many others stand aside aghast, some believing the only hope now is for the revolution to happen and fail so that life as we know it can somehow be restored \u2026 But that\u2019s enough about the England and Wales Cricket Board and its 16.4-over competition between confected teams (The Hundred) which is due to dominate future seasons. If it bears some resemblance to some other current situation, well, we are living in crazed times. As Lord\u2019s goes, so goes the Commons. In both cases, however, the present day is unaffected. It\u2019s holiday time, hooray. The weather has been what we used to call lovely. Even that is now a source of future alarm, but it doesn\u2019t feel very alarming from my hammock. And on Thursday the grandest and most immutable of all cricket events begins: the Ashes. On my wall is a Punch cartoon from 1926, by Kenneth Beauchamp. On a country lane, a grand dame in a fur coat is talking to a man in a flat cap who might be her gamekeeper. \u201cAnd do you think, Mr Jones,\u201d she is saying, \u201cour men will get the cinders back from the Australians?\u201d (The charm of the art makes it funnier than it sounds.) Nearly a hundred years on, the same question is being asked, if less universally. England did get the cinders back in 1926, winning at the Oval after four draws. It was a wet summer and far from a vintage series. The whole tour lasted from April to mid-September and included such exotica as a three-day fixture against the Civil Service at Chiswick. But the Tests were spread over the months of high summer: by August only the Oval was left. They did not start with ripening apples and the football season. The ball is still red and the clothes still white. The attendances 93 years ago were pretty much what we might expect now: an average 20,000 a day. Pretty much everything else will have changed including the concept of the umpire\u2019s decision being final, once regarded as the epitome of English decency and sense.

Forty-eight men\u2019s teams and 48 women\u2019s teams competed in one of the most grueling, graceful, explosive, and entertaining sports being played today.

The modern beach volleyball game of two-person teams <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120813235054/http://www.bvbinfo.com/SandsSneak.asp?issue=3\">was invented in 1930 by Paul \u201cPablo\u201d Johnson</a> on the Santa Monica beach. Bored with waiting for the rest of the players to arrive, he and three others mapped out a smaller court and began playing the first recorded game of two-a-side beach volleyball. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s and 1980s that beach volleyball became popular as, not just a sport, but a representative of beach culture. Surfing and volleyball became intertwined in the public\u2019s mind and watching either came to represent an endless summer vibe of beach parties that lasted long into the night. If 1960s movies popularized the teen surfing scene as innocent Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello romping in the sand, the addition of beach volleyball in the 1980s added a bad-boy element, like remaking <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058953/\">Beach Blanket Bingo</a> but directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Jack Nicholson and Robert DeNiro.</p> <p>The professional beach volleyball stars of the 1980s played like pioneers of any sport: passionate and freewheeling, knowing they were defining the sport as it grew.

But as the sport\u2019s popularity continues to grow, Americans are facing tougher and tougher competition.

The final score of 23-21, 23-21 shows the Americans had opportunities to win in both sets, but were ultimately unable to capitalize. Despite each team having a 6ft 5in player blocking at the net, the standout player was Canada\u2019s 5ft 9in Pavan, who dug meteoric spikes and placed shots with surgical precision. The men\u2019s gold medal match between Russia and Germany was equally thrilling, with Russia winning the tie-breaking set. In both finals \u2013 and in all the matches leading up to them \u2013 fans witnessed amazing feats of athleticism.

      "bodyText": "A conversation with an unnamed Yass farmer, not the interests of his farming family, had spurred the minister for energy, Angus Taylor, to seek briefings from the environment department about a listing to protect native grasslands, he told parliament on Monday. In a personal explanation to the House of Representatives, Taylor sought to deflect further questions and a possible Senate inquiry into meetings he had with bureaucrats on the grasslands laws in 2017. The inquiry moved by Labor and the Greens into the conduct of Taylor and the former environment minister Josh Frydenberg was narrowly voted down after it failed to gain support from One Nation senators and Cory Bernardi. Taylor has been grilled for the last fortnight over the clearing of native grasslands at a property near Delegate on the Monaro plains owned by a company called Jam Land. The company is chaired by his brother Richard, and Taylor himself has an interest through his family company. An investigation by the Guardian revealed that Taylor had asked for briefings by the federal environment department within a day or two of compliance officers attending the property to discuss the illegal land clearing with Jam Land. But Taylor has defended his request for briefings and says that it was motivated by constituent concerns. While his family\u2019s properties are in the seat of Eden-Monaro, there are also some of the critically endangered grasslands in Taylor\u2019s seat of Hume, which is further north and centred on Goulburn. \u201cIn late 2016 and early 2017, I spoke with farmers from Boorowa and Goulburn, in my electorate, and Yass, which had been in Hume until mid-2016, about this listing and their concerns with the listing,\u201d he told the parliament. \u201cOn 21 February 2017, I spoke with a farmer near Yass who expressed strong and detailed concerns about the revised listing, pointing out that it had occurred despite the concerns of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and NSW Farmers, and with little consultation with farmers themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of these farmers were completely disconnected from our family farming operations.

He said he \u201cmade it clear [the briefing] was not to include any discussion of compliance matters\u201d. He said the FOI documents, obtained by the Guardian, showed that the meeting was \u201cto answer questions on the technical aspects of the listing outcome\u201d and that they would \u201cstay out of completely\u201d any compliance action under way. The documents highlight that departmental officers were acutely aware that there was a potential for serious conflicts of interest to arise because the Taylor-controlled Jam Land was under investigation and could be facing hefty fines or an order to rehabilitate the grasslands. Taylor said he attended a meeting on 20 March 2017. \u201cAt no time during this meeting, was any compliance matter, or any personal interest of mine, discussed. At that meeting we discussed precisely what the department had said we would discuss. \u201cI have had no association with the events leading to the compliance action that has been the subject of these allegations, and I have never made a representation in relation to it. I never would. All available information supports my repeated statements that the compliance action was never raised,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus was advocating for the interests of the farmers in my electorate and across the region. This is my job as the elected representative for Hume with a large farming population and agriculture sector,\u201d he added. Taylor also tabled a 2014 letter from the National Farmers\u2019 Federation that expressed \u201cserious concerns about the revised listing\u201d. The letter says the federation was worried individual farmers would not be able to assess their responsibilities under the EPBC Act and that more work should be done mapping the distribution of the grasslands. However, a departmental briefing note, produced ahead of Taylor\u2019s 2017 meeting with department officials, and obtained by Guardian Australia under FOI laws, states the \u201cNFF did not oppose the listing but asked for further clarification on some issues with the listing assessment and raised some concerns about complexity for farmers\u201d. The department said it had responded and addressed the NFF\u2019s concerns and some broader issues raised regarding the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It said the NFF didn\u2019t reply in writing again, but there were \u201congoing conversations\u201d with them for two years following their submission until the then environment minister Greg Hunt made his final decision in 2016. \u201cThis culminated in publication of a post-listing information guide that the NFF helped the department draft to address their concerns about helping farmers better understand the listing,\u201d the briefing states. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor used question time on Monday to again grill Taylor over the matter, including whether any constituent concerns had ever been expressed to him in writing. The opposition\u2019s leader of business, Tony Burke, said Taylor had now given the parliament three reasons for his meeting with the department. \u201cOne, somebody wrote a letter six months after the meeting that was addressed to somebody else. Two, somebody wrote a letter three years before the meeting that was addressed to somebody else and, three, he had a conversation with a bloke in Yass,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIsn\u2019t the only consistent interest here his own?\u201d Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, told the Senate Taylor had failed to \u201cprovide any evidence he was representing anybody\u2019s interests but himself\u201d. Taylor defended not disclosing his interest in Jam Land in his pecuniary interest statement to the parliament. He said he had properly disclosed the two holding entities, Gufee, his family investment company, and Australian Farming Partnerships, which he described as a legal partnership with his brothers and a business associate, Tony Reid. If the Register of Interests were required to record minority, non-controlling interests held at three levels down in a family company structure, this would be a major change to the current practice.",

Approval is expected in the fourth quarter this year. So far the government has spent $36.3m on the demolition, a spokesman for the minister for sport, John Sidoti, said. This leaves $693m for construction. The knock-down and rebuild has been controversial because the stadium is just 30 years old and there were earlier costings that suggested it could be refurbished for as little as $85m. The highly influential trust that controls the stadium had been pushing hard for the total rebuild prior to the election, even though the former premier Mike Baird appeared to have abandoned it. Members include the former premier Barry O\u2019Farrell, broadcaster Alan Jones and the former head of construction giant Transfield, Tony Shepherd. The main reasons that the trust wanted a rebuild was that the corporate boxes and the catering facilities were inadequate. There was also a shortage of toilets and, more recently, the trust produced a safety report saying the stadium was a fire and security risk. The government has said it will not be asking Lendlease to tender and will be looking at other construction companies. Berejiklian said the government wanted to get the best value for money and Lendlease could not deliver that. \u201cThe advice provided to government was that we could get a better deal and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she told reporters on Monday. \u201cWe won\u2019t be taken for a ride. We don\u2019t want anyone to take for granted the NSW taxpayer. We don\u2019t want anyone to take the government for granted.\u201d Lendlease built the recently completed Western Sydney stadium at Parramatta. The project was completed on time and within its $360m. The Coalition government has also vowed to refurbish ANZ Stadium at Olympic Park at a cost of $810m.",

      "body": "<p>Stacey Dooley is so fresh-faced she could pass for a teenager. But, at 32, she has been making investigative programmes for 12 years, and has clocked up 80-odd documentaries around the world, taking on terrorists, paedophile networks, rightwing extremists and international drug dealers. She has just returned from Syria, where she met European Islamic State brides for her first Panorama; and Nigeria, where she got to know Boko Haram\u2019s female suicide bombers. Last year, she wrote a <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/on-the-front-line-with-the-women-who-fight-back-9781785942990.html\" title=\"\">bestselling book about inspirational women</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/15/strictly-come-dancing-final-stacey-dooley-wins-paso-doble\" title=\"\">won Strictly Come Dancing</a>. On Friday it was announced that she had signed a \u00a3250,000-a-year golden handcuffs deal to work only for the BBC.</p> <p>Earlier this year, she found herself splashed across the tabloids \u2013 first for starting a relationship with her Strictly dance partner Kevin Clifton, then for being labelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/24/stacey-dooley-comic-relief-row-david-lammy-white-saviour\" title=\"\">\u201ca white saviour\u201d</a> by the Labour MP David Lammy after making a Comic Relief documentary and posting a photo of herself and a young Ugandan child on social media. It\u2019s been a busy old time.</p> <p>Dooley is a one-off: a working-class woman who left school with no qualifications, swears like a trooper, reports from the world\u2019s most hostile territories and frequently tops the TV ratings charts. She has achieved the seemingly impossible \u2013 presenting programmes about subjects so bleak they would make most BBC editors blanch, while encouraging a generation of news-shy young people to embrace world affairs. Women, children, the marginalised and the exploited are at the heart of her documentaries. Last year, she <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/1480c35f-df66-4208-a1dd-ca9e501094ea\" title=\"\">won an MBE</a> for her services to journalism.</p> <p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Stacey,\u201d she says with a wink and a handshake when we meet in a London restaurant. Her fans might expect a hug \u2013 she is famously tactile in her documentaries \u2013 but perhaps the real Dooley is more complex than the empathetic naif who loves to tell it straight. Sure, she is warm and direct, but she is also businesslike.</p> <p>Dooley says she is the hardest-working person she knows. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my few talents,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a decent work ethic, probably because of my mother, when it was just her and me. She just worked so hard. She\u2019d get up at silly o\u2019clock, clean her pal\u2019s house, then do her day job, then work in pubs at night.\u201d Dooley\u2019s father, who had a drink problem, was not part of her life. Her mother later met her partner, Norman, and they had a child together \u2013 Dooley\u2019s sister. Both girls were bridesmaids at their wedding. But it was the early years that shaped Dooley.</p> <p>She grew up with her mother in Luton, in Bedfordshire, surrounded by rightwing extremists and Islamist fundamentalists. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson, went to her school (she confronted him and al-Muhajiroun activists in the film <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcthree/2012/02/my-hometown-fanatics-stacey-dooley.shtml\" title=\"\">My Hometown Fanatics</a>). Young Stacey was mouthy and opinionated. Again, she says, it was down to her mother. \u201cMy mum stands up for what she thinks is right. She\u2019s tough.\u201d Has Dooley got that toughness? \u201cYes. I\u2019ve always been quite bloody-minded. You\u2019ve got to have the courage to say what you believe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fef11a7b4b38b9874fb3ab38381c22c74587ae37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fef11a7b4b38b9874fb3ab38381c22c74587ae37/0_80_4069_2441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Dooley in Face To Face With Bounty Hunters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacey Dooley flanked by two officers in Face To Face With Bounty Hunters, her forthcoming BBC Three documentary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Lob-Levyt/BBC/TI Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That bloody-mindedness came into its own in her early teens. \u201cI was a nightmare.\u201d In what way? \u201cI wasn\u2019t frightened of authority. I just did whatever I wanted.\u201d She started drinking, clubbing, bunking off school. \u201cI probably drove my mum loopy. I wouldn\u2019t come home and I\u2019d be out smoking and drinking.\u201d Anything else? \u201cI\u2019d steal.\u201d She smiles. \u201cNothing ridiculous like cars. I\u2019d just go down the Arndale and rob a couple of Morgan tops. The thing I nicked the most was blue eyeliner from the chemist. I was always wearing blue eyeliner and blue mascara, which, on reflection, probably wasn\u2019t my best look.\u201d Did she steal with friends? \u201cYes. But I was good. I never got caught.\u201d</p> <p>These days, she says, she\u2019s a goody-goody \u2013 no smoking, no drinking, no tea-leafing. As for drugs, she has never touched them. She says she saw too much when she was growing up. \u201cWe lost a friend to drugs; we lost another friend to drink. He didn\u2019t reach 18. We all used to drink. Then you get yourself in a mess and you fall asleep and choke on your own sick \u2026\u201d She trails off. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the moment I thought: \u2018I\u2019m never drinking again.\u2019 But I\u2019m sure it makes you think twice.\u201d</p> <p>Dooley says the story that she left school at 15 without qualifications is not quite right. She turned up for three of her GCSEs (English, Music and Biology), but she never bothered collecting her results. Her face lights up. \u201cMaybe I did really well. I might have got three As and I\u2019ve been underselling myself all this time!\u201d</p> <p>She sold perfume by day at Luton airport and did pub work in the evening, spending all her money on clothes \u2013 most of them cheap and throwaway. One day, her mother spotted an advert for young people who were obsessed with fast fashion to go to India and discover how their clothes were made. \u201cIt said: \u2018Do you like travel, do you like fashion, do you like telly?\u2019 And for me it was tick, tick, tick.\u201d As soon as she applied for the job, she knew she would get it. Again, the Dooley confidence. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think: \u2018Why not me?\u2019 They\u2019ve got to have someone.\u201d</p> <p>Watch <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b0xsh\" title=\"\">Blood, Sweat and T-shirts</a> now, 10 years on, and you can see that Dooley arrived almost fully formed. She was unfiltered, pasionate and addressed the camera as if it was her best friend. In one scene, after talking to a tiny boy who was sent by his family to work in a Bombay factory, she turns to the camera, outraged and tearful. \u201cSorry, the boss of the factory Mohammed was working at used to beat him up really bad, so he ran away. He\u2019s just a baby and he got beaten up by a grown man. It just makes you feel sick.\u201d The tears became another Dooley trademark.</p> <p>After returning from India she was invited by the then controller of BBC Three, Danny Cohen, to make her own documentaries. She asked simple, heartfelt questions that trained journalists were often too polite or cerebral to ask. Occasionally, Dooley has almost become a self-parody \u2013 asking for a couple of minutes while she turns away to weep, ranting at the world\u2019s injustices, wrapping her arms around a victim she has just met.

      "bodyText": "Stacey Dooley is so fresh-faced she could pass for a teenager. But, at 32, she has been making investigative programmes for 12 years, and has clocked up 80-odd documentaries around the world, taking on terrorists, paedophile networks, rightwing extremists and international drug dealers. She has just returned from Syria, where she met European Islamic State brides for her first Panorama; and Nigeria, where she got to know Boko Haram\u2019s female suicide bombers. Last year, she wrote a bestselling book about inspirational women and won Strictly Come Dancing. On Friday it was announced that she had signed a \u00a3250,000-a-year golden handcuffs deal to work only for the BBC. Earlier this year, she found herself splashed across the tabloids \u2013 first for starting a relationship with her Strictly dance partner Kevin Clifton, then for being labelled \u201ca white saviour\u201d by the Labour MP David Lammy after making a Comic Relief documentary and posting a photo of herself and a young Ugandan child on social media. It\u2019s been a busy old time. Dooley is a one-off: a working-class woman who left school with no qualifications, swears like a trooper, reports from the world\u2019s most hostile territories and frequently tops the TV ratings charts. She has achieved the seemingly impossible \u2013 presenting programmes about subjects so bleak they would make most BBC editors blanch, while encouraging a generation of news-shy young people to embrace world affairs. Women, children, the marginalised and the exploited are at the heart of her documentaries. Last year, she won an MBE for her services to journalism. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Stacey,\u201d she says with a wink and a handshake when we meet in a London restaurant. Her fans might expect a hug \u2013 she is famously tactile in her documentaries \u2013 but perhaps the real Dooley is more complex than the empathetic naif who loves to tell it straight. Sure, she is warm and direct, but she is also businesslike. Dooley says she is the hardest-working person she knows. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my few talents,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a decent work ethic, probably because of my mother, when it was just her and me. She just worked so hard. She\u2019d get up at silly o\u2019clock, clean her pal\u2019s house, then do her day job, then work in pubs at night.\u201d Dooley\u2019s father, who had a drink problem, was not part of her life. Her mother later met her partner, Norman, and they had a child together \u2013 Dooley\u2019s sister. Both girls were bridesmaids at their wedding. But it was the early years that shaped Dooley. She grew up with her mother in Luton, in Bedfordshire, surrounded by rightwing extremists and Islamist fundamentalists. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson, went to her school (she confronted him and al-Muhajiroun activists in the film My Hometown Fanatics). Young Stacey was mouthy and opinionated. Again, she says, it was down to her mother. \u201cMy mum stands up for what she thinks is right. She\u2019s tough.\u201d Has Dooley got that toughness? \u201cYes. I\u2019ve always been quite bloody-minded. You\u2019ve got to have the courage to say what you believe.\u201d That bloody-mindedness came into its own in her early teens. \u201cI was a nightmare.\u201d In what way? \u201cI wasn\u2019t frightened of authority. I just did whatever I wanted.\u201d She started drinking, clubbing, bunking off school. \u201cI probably drove my mum loopy. I wouldn\u2019t come home and I\u2019d be out smoking and drinking.\u201d Anything else? \u201cI\u2019d steal.\u201d She smiles. \u201cNothing ridiculous like cars. I\u2019d just go down the Arndale and rob a couple of Morgan tops. The thing I nicked the most was blue eyeliner from the chemist. I was always wearing blue eyeliner and blue mascara, which, on reflection, probably wasn\u2019t my best look.\u201d Did she steal with friends? \u201cYes. But I was good. I never got caught.\u201d These days, she says, she\u2019s a goody-goody \u2013 no smoking, no drinking, no tea-leafing. As for drugs, she has never touched them. She says she saw too much when she was growing up. \u201cWe lost a friend to drugs; we lost another friend to drink. He didn\u2019t reach 18. We all used to drink. Then you get yourself in a mess and you fall asleep and choke on your own sick \u2026\u201d She trails off. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the moment I thought: \u2018I\u2019m never drinking again.\u2019 But I\u2019m sure it makes you think twice.\u201d Dooley says the story that she left school at 15 without qualifications is not quite right. She turned up for three of her GCSEs (English, Music and Biology), but she never bothered collecting her results. Her face lights up. \u201cMaybe I did really well. I might have got three As and I\u2019ve been underselling myself all this time!\u201d She sold perfume by day at Luton airport and did pub work in the evening, spending all her money on clothes \u2013 most of them cheap and throwaway. One day, her mother spotted an advert for young people who were obsessed with fast fashion to go to India and discover how their clothes were made. \u201cIt said: \u2018Do you like travel, do you like fashion, do you like telly?\u2019 And for me it was tick, tick, tick.\u201d As soon as she applied for the job, she knew she would get it. Again, the Dooley confidence. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think: \u2018Why not me?\u2019 They\u2019ve got to have someone.\u201d Watch Blood, Sweat and T-shirts now, 10 years on, and you can see that Dooley arrived almost fully formed. She was unfiltered, pasionate and addressed the camera as if it was her best friend. In one scene, after talking to a tiny boy who was sent by his family to work in a Bombay factory, she turns to the camera, outraged and tearful. \u201cSorry, the boss of the factory Mohammed was working at used to beat him up really bad, so he ran away. He\u2019s just a baby and he got beaten up by a grown man. It just makes you feel sick.\u201d The tears became another Dooley trademark. After returning from India she was invited by the then controller of BBC Three, Danny Cohen, to make her own documentaries. She asked simple, heartfelt questions that trained journalists were often too polite or cerebral to ask. Occasionally, Dooley has almost become a self-parody \u2013 asking for a couple of minutes while she turns away to weep, ranting at the world\u2019s injustices, wrapping her arms around a victim she has just met. But so much of her portfolio is amazing \u2013 asking an Isis fighter who said he had killed 900 people and raped 200 women: \u201cWhat was going through your mind when these girls were screaming for you to stop and you don\u2019t?\u201d; telling a drug dealer he is a hypocrite because he wouldn\u2019t dream of selling to his children; confronting women who have sold their children for sex. Has she become addicted to violence and war zones like so many foreign correspondents? No, she says, she can\u2019t wait to get away. So many people who do her work have PTSD, she says, but she\u2019s lucky. She doesn\u2019t even have nightmares. \u201cI think it\u2019s because my mind is clear \u2026 You have to look after yourself mentally when you\u2019re making films about incest and paedophilia and cartels cutting people\u2019s heads off.\u201d After a tough day, she switches off by listening to Little Mix. (\u201cI love Woman Like Me.\u201d Does her work scare her? \u201cI\u2019m such a wimp. I don\u2019t even like flying, so it is slightly ridiculous that I do this job.\u201d She says she was most terrified in north-east Nigeria. \u201cI was in Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and there were times when I thought I might have to leave early because I can\u2019t handle feeling frightened like this. Every night you could hear the military shelling, and you\u2019re thinking: \u2018How am I going to get out?\u2019\u201d Did she tell her mother she was in Maiduguri? She grins. \u201cNo, I told her I was in Lagos.\u201d How does your mum feel about you lying? \u201cIt\u2019s for her own good because all she would do is panic.\u201d Dooley\u2019s work has politicised her.

Dooley knows she is not universally liked, and takes pride in it. \u201cI\u2019m not vanilla,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the start of my career, some people were like: \u2018This is a breath of fresh air\u2019; others: \u2018There are thousands of trained journalists that deserve her job.\u2019\u201d Is there an advantage to not being trained?

What\u2019s the worst thing they have said? \u201cOh God, I\u2019ve had it all. Sometimes they would say: \u2018Ooh, you\u2019ve got holes in your jeans,\u2019 or mimic my accent.\u201d Did she give them a mouthful? \u201cNo.\u201d Why not? \u201cBecause I don\u2019t give a fuck what they think.

I think the BBC would be the first to say current affairs is still too white and too middle-class and too male-heavy.\u201d What she says about people being heard is interesting, particularly in light of Lammy\u2019s \u201cwhite saviour\u201d attack on her. She fought back ferociously on Twitter. Does she think she might have misjudged it \u2013 that it would have been better to say \u2018Let\u2019s have a chat\u2019 rather than beat him into submission? \u201cI did say that a couple of times, but they never pick up on it. I would love to have spoken to David.\u201d Does she now think he had a point? \u201cI would take on board the criticism and bear in mind that people have certain views and I can\u2019t tell people how to feel.

Going forward, I hope we\u2019re able to keep raising money in a way that everyone feels comfy with.\u201d It\u2019s funny \u2013 for a moment she sounds like a politician. When Dooley was invited to compete on Strictly, she was already well known. Now she is a household name. How has it changed her life? \u201cThere\u2019s more interest in my personal life.\u201d Is she surprised? \u201cYes.\u201d Really? \u201cYes!

I think that\u2019s how it was for most observers and it has fed into our collective response to the race; he has been acknowledged for his part in making a thrilling contest but the pile of bouquets thrown in his direction does not compare with the floral mountain being heaped up in front of Enable.</p> \n<p>This is, of course, terribly unjust because, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/24/talking-horses-enable-unfair-advantage-mares-allowance-king-george-queen-elizabeth-stakes-ascot-horse-racing-tips\">as Talking Horses regulars know only too well</a>, he was carrying 3lb more than her. According to the official BHA scale, 3lb equates to two lengths in mile and a half races. On the bare facts of Saturday\u2019s result, Crystal Ocean is a marginally better horse than Enable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/28/enable-may-bypass-york-head-straight-for-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-john-gosden-horse-racing\">Enable may head straight for Arc and career finale, hints Gosden</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Perhaps she\u2019d have found more if required in the closing stages; her jockey made less use of the whip than his. But I reckon that, all other things being as they were on Saturday, Crystal Ocean would have won that race at level weights.</p> \n<p>Setting such provocative thoughts to one side, let\u2019s take a moment to weigh up Crystal Ocean and ensure that he gets his due, despite the indignity of defeat. Since the race, I\u2019ve seen people referring to him as a \u201cGroup Three horse\u201d as a means of insisting on the superiority of their heroine. These people should ask themselves if they really have any natural fondness for horses, because he is undoubtedly a magnificent beast.</p> \n<p>Crystal Ocean has run 16 times and never finished worse than third. Yes, he has failed in four of his five attempts in Group Ones but only one of those was an emphatic defeat. He was beaten just half a length in the Leger and has been held at bay by a neck in the King George for the past two years.</p> \n<p>Ah yes, the Leger of 2017. Crystal Ocean couldn\u2019t beat Capri that day but it\u2019s worth listing some of those who finished behind him in one of the best runnings of the Doncaster Classic: Stradivarius, Rekindling (who won the Melbourne Cup next time), Coronet and Defoe.</p> \n<p>Like many a Sir Michael Stoute-trained horse before him, Crystal Ocean has toughened up with age. His Royal Ascot defeat of Magical was impressively game and his appetite for a battle shows no sign of losing its edge. Only when he trailed Cracksman by six lengths last year could you say he\u2019d had an off day.</p> \n<p>The four best runs of his career yielded Racing Post Ratings of 129, 128, 128 and 127. Enable\u2019s top four have been 129, 128, 127 and 126. Like it or not, Enable fans, they\u2019re practically as good as each other and, not to come over all <a href=\"https://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/kevin-keegan-v-alex-ferguson-full-transcript-from-the-famous-i-will-love-it-interview-384830\">Kevin Keegan</a>, I would love it, love it if they both showed up in the Arc. I think his owner will, in the end, prefer to send him somewhere she isn\u2019t running. But if Crystal Ocean runs at Longchamp, then she\u2019s got to go there and do something.</p> \n<h2>Monday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>We\u2019re back on the bread and butter, for one day only before Goodwood starts, but there\u2019s plenty of flavour in the card at Ayr. Obviously, there\u2019s <strong>Land Of Oz (3.00)</strong>, a well-bred Sir Mark Prescott horse who started handicaps on a low mark and, surprise, surprise, won such a race at the second attempt. The extra distance will help and these mostly older horses will have their hands full trying to contain him, which is why he\u2019s even-money.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s 14-1 available about <strong>Royal Shaheen (4.30)</strong>, down from the early 40-1. He comes from the Alistair Whillans yard that had nary a winner between January and the start of this month but has had four (including one over jumps) in the past fortnight. We haven\u2019t seen Royal Shaheen since mid-June and the stable\u2019s fortunes have revived considerably since then. He\u2019s 5lb below the mark from which he made all to win this race last year.</p> \n<p>A couple of excuses could be made for the Chester defeat suffered by <strong>Luzum (3.30)</strong> last time and he still looks well treated. I\u2019ll chance Mick Easterby\u2019s runner at 8-1.</p> \n<p><strong>Jackamundo (4.00)</strong> takes on a Godolphin favourite and perhaps he\u2019ll be outclassed but odds of 4-1 understate the chance of this progressive type who is two from two since being stepped up to this distance on softish ground.</p> \n<p>You can get 11-4 about <strong>Nigg Bay (6.50)</strong> at Ffos Las, from the Johnny Levins yard that has won with its last three runners and has a 27% strike-rate in Britain. This one had just a head in hand, as it were, when he scored on his British debut at Ayr three weeks ago but he\u2019s only been raised 3lb and the runner-up has since won twice.</p> \n<p>Later on the card, <strong>Craneur (8.00)</strong> may be worth a look at 2-1. He put up a career best at Salisbury last time when run out of it close home by Hydroplane, another Sir Mark production who has since won twice more.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d903b984-0f5a-4d23-a83c-f24c5d2c1834\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Ayr&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>2.00</b> Makyon <b>2.30</b> Sienna Dream <b>3.00</b> Land Of Oz (nb) <b>3.30</b> Luzum <b>4.00</b> Jackamundo <b>4.30</b> Royal Shaheen <b>5.05</b> Jacob's Pillow&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Newton Abbot&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>2.15</b> Parody <b>2.45</b> Fifty Shades <b>3.15</b> Chapmanshype <b>3.45 </b>Teaser <b>4.15</b> Ourmullion <b>4.45</b> As You Like <b>5.15</b> Josie Abbing&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Windsor&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>5.00</b> Aria Rose <b>5.35</b> Bright Red <b>6.05</b> Smokey Bear <b>6.40</b> Mukha Magic <b>7.15</b> Typhoon Ten <b>7.50</b> Molls Memory <b>8.20</b> Mums Hope&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ffos Las</b></p>\n    <p><b>5.10</b> Delachance <b>5.45</b> Berlin Tango <b>6.15</b> Young General <b>6.50</b> Nigg Bay (nap) <b>7.25</b> Dell' Arca <b>8.00</b> Craneur <b>8.30</b> Cuttin' Edge&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Bournemouth are ready to sell Harry Arter, with Fulham, Stoke and Sheffield United all interested, and \u201care actively looking in the market\u201d for further recruits, says Eddie Howe. Newcastle are after PSG\u2019s Stanley N\u2019Soki, a 20-year-old defender. Cardiff are close to sewing up a \u00a32m deal for Oxford\u2019s Gavin Whyte, a 23-year-old winger. Nottingham Forest, meanwhile, are preparing a fresh bid for Aberdeen\u2019s 22-year-old defender Scott McKenna, with Burnley\u2019s Ben Gibson next on their list should that deal fall through. Blackpool will spend \u00a3750,000 on Blackburn\u2019s 22-year-old striker Joe Nuttall.",

The \u201cPayment Duration\u201d table shows the average payment duration for all people on Newstart in December 2018 was 156 weeks or three years. [16]</p> \n  <p>The Payment Duration table shows that of all the 722,923 people getting Newstart in December 2018, 241,415 or 33% received it for under one year, almost 18% or 128,139 were on the payment for one to two years, 200,196 or 27% were on it for two to five years, just over 17% or 125,408 people had been on the benefit for between five and 10 years and 27,765 or just under 4% had been getting it for over 10 years. This table shows about 66% of people on Newstart were receiving the benefit for between one to 10 years. [16]</p> \n  <p>Another table in the same data document titled \u201cExits 12 months\u201d shows the number of people who began receiving Newstart between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017. This 2017 table shows there were 376,031 people who started receiving Newstart in 2017. Of this 2017 group, 236,530 exited within 12 months or 63 per cent. [16] This table supports the claim that two thirds of people on Newstart existed within 12 months but only for 2017.</p> \n  <p>A July 25, 2019 investigation by Crikey using Department of Social Services data found \u201cthe proportion of Newstart recipients on payments for more than a year climbed from 69% in 2014, to 73% in 2016 and to 76.5% in 2018. [17]</p> \n  <p>The Guardian Australia found on July 23 that the government was using select Newstart payment data between January-December 2017 to support its claim. [18]</p> \n  <p>The Conversation found on July 24, 2019, the contradiction between the government\u2019s claim that most people who enter Newstart quickly leave compared to most people on Newstart who have been on it for a long time, was the difference between flow and stock. It found most Newstart recipients had to survive on Newstart long-term and \u201cat any one time the overwhelming majority of the people\u201d on Newstart had \u201cbeen on it for more than a year\u201d. [19]</p> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) has also disputed the government\u2019s claim stating: \u201ctwo thirds of people receiving Newstart have received the payment for 12 months or more\u201d. [20]</p> \n  <p>Based on this evidence <strong>AAP FactCheck</strong> found the claim that \u201ctwo thirds of Newstart recipients end that payment within 12 months,\u201d made by ministers McKenzie, Frydenberg, Dutton, Cormann and Fletcher, plus senators Askew and Stoker and Wentworth MP Dave Sharma, to be false.</p> \n  <p>The correct number of people who have ceased receiving Newstart within 12 months was one third, according to Department of Social Services\u2019 ongoing data, not two thirds as government ministers claimed. The government\u2019s claim is only true when referring to the number of people who started and exited Newstart in the 2017 calendar year.</p> \n  <h2>The Verdict</h2> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Mostly False</strong> - <strong>The checkable claim is mostly false, with one minor element of truth. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-29T07:14:05.653Z\">at 8.14am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3e9a168f08cf92bb778e24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-29T07:04:43.274Z\">8.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>AAP has done a fact check on the claim that \u201ctwo thirds of Newstart recipients end that payment within 12 months\u201d, a statement made by <strong>Bridget McKenzie, Mathias Cormann, Dave Sharma, Wendy Askew, Peter Dutton, Amanda Stoker, Josh Frydenberg </strong>and<strong> Paul Fletcher. </strong></p> \n  <p><strong>AAP FactCheck</strong> examined Senator McKenzie\u2019s claim that two thirds of people on Newstart end that payment within 12 months and found the exact same claim had been repeated by four other government ministers, two senators and a backbencher dating back to April 2019.</p> \n  <p>On July 26, 2019 finance minister Mathias Cormann was quoted as saying: \u201cTwo thirds of people on Newstart allowance are on it for less than a year, it is not designed to be an ongoing payment,\u201d he said. [3]</p> \n  <p>The federal member for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, made the same claim on Sky TV on July 24, 2019 stating: \u201cTwo thirds of people who are on Newstart have often found employment within 12 months\u201d. [4]</p> \n  <p>During a Senate debate on July 22, 2019, Tasmanian senator Wendy Askew said: \u201caround two-thirds of jobseekers who are granted Newstart exit income support within 12 months\u201d. [5] Home affairs minister Peter Dutton made the same claim on July 19, 2019, stating \u201ctwo-thirds of people come off Newstart within 12 months\u201d. [6]</p> \n  <p>In a Facebook post on May 11, 2019 addressing criticism the Newstart Allowance wasn\u2019t increased in the budget, Senator Amanda Stoker stated \u201cAround two thirds of those granted Newstart exit income support within 12 months\u201d. [7]</p> \n  <p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg repeated the same line on May 6, 2019, stating \u201cthe other thing about Newstart is two-thirds of the people come off within 12 months and go into a job\u201d. [8]</p> \n  <p>Former social services minister, now communications minister Paul Fletcher, was quoted as saying \u201caround two-thirds of those on Newstart exited income support within 12 months\u201d on April 30, 2019. [9]</p> \n  <p>The Newstart Allowance is an income support payment for people aged from 22 but under Age Pension age who are actively looking for work. [10]</p> \n  <p>Singles with no children get a maximum of $278 per week/$555.70 per fortnight - or about $40 a day, while couples receive a maximum $251 each per week/$501.1 per fortnight. [11]</p> \n  <p>The payment has not increased in real terms for 25 years. [12]</p> \n  <p>Former prime minister John Howard, former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, minister for resources and Northern Australia Matt Canavan, Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos and a number of Coalition backbenchers have joined Labor and the Greens in calling for the government to raise the benefit. [13] [14]</p> \n  <p>Prime minister Scott Morrison has stated he\u2019d rather give a welfare boost to pensioners than the unemployed. [15]</p> \n  <p>A spokesperson for Senator McKenzie advised <strong>AAP FactCheck</strong> the source of her claim was data.gov.au, the central source of Australian open government data.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-29T07:12:01.692Z\">at 8.12am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3e99168f08cf92bb778e20\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-29T06:59:42.808Z\">7.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Adam Bandt</strong> raised this in question time, but that is about as much as we have heard on this today. From Bandt\u2019s office:</p> \n  <p>Greens Member for Melbourne <strong>Adam Bandt</strong> MP said today that the prime minister failed to assure the House that none of his ministers had lobbied on behalf of Crown casino, in breach of his Ministerial Code of Conduct, and that no Home Affairs officials had acted improperly.<br></p> \n  <p>Last night\u2019s <em>60 Minutes </em>report and recent reporting in The Age/Sydney Morning Herald has claimed a senior Home Affairs official was lobbied by several members of parliament, including two ministers, to help fast-track visas and airport entry for Crown high rollers.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese reports are very concerning and the prime minister has refused to assure the House that none of his ministers acted improperly,\u201d said Mr Bandt.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s response is not good enough. He cannot wash his hands of this. He must to get to the bottom of whether his ministers and the Home Affairs Department have been involved in this scandal and report to the parliament about what action his government will take.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Greens democracy spokesperson, Senator <strong>Larissa Waters, </strong>said:</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is why we need an anti-corruption body. The ministerial standards are routinely ignored. The PM had a chance in both Houses of Parliament today to outline the investigations he is undertaking in relation to these latest alleged breaches and the answer was nothing.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/28/domestic-abuse-survivors-angered-by-federal-funding-for-couples-counselling\">Guardian Australia reported at the weekend</a> that women\u2019s safety groups had raised concerns about the Specialised Family Violence Services package, which was announced in the budget.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>The Greens deputy leader, Larissa Waters</strong>, said the government had acted against the advice of experts in the field and the money should go to specialist domestic and family violence services, rather than faith-based family relationship services. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cFrontline services desperately need more funding,\u201d she said. <br></p> \n  <p>The motion called on the government to \u201censure [survivors are] not forced to undergo counselling with perpetrators\u201d, a claim which <strong>the social services minister, Anne Ruston</strong>, said was \u201cmisleading\u201d. <br><br>Ruston said providers did not force survivors to undergo counselling with perpetrators. <br><br>\u201cThe government believes we should provide a wide range of services to encourage women to come forward,\u201d she said.</p> \n  <p>The

The government still wants to talk unions, but who knows what the day will hold. It\u2019s that sort of week. It\u2019s party room day (and caucus) so we will bring you what the parties are talking about. And no doubt Angus Taylor will remain popular, at least from Labor\u2019s point of view.

We\u2019ll all be back tomorrow morning. I hope you will be too. As always - take care of you. The Senate passed the maritime boundary legislation a little bit ago, prompting this joint statement with four ministers names to it (Scott Morrison, Marise Payne, Josh Frydenberg and Matt Canavan) Today, the Australian Parliament passed legislation to implement the treaty between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste Establishing their Maritime Boundaries in the Timor Sea. The treaty establishes permanent maritime boundaries between our two countries and a stable legal framework for the development of gas and oil resources in the Timor Sea. It upholds Australia\u2019s commitment to international rules and the peaceful resolution of disputes, and reflects our full commitment to the independence, sovereignty and economic sustainability of Timor-Leste. Since the signing of the treaty on 6 March 2018, the Australian Government has worked with the Timor-Leste Government and offshore petroleum operators on transitional arrangements that provide commercial certainty and security for all the parties. With the passage of the treaty\u2019s implementing legislation today, Australia is now ready to partner with Timor-Leste to jointly develop the Greater Sunrise gas fields for the benefit of both countries. Greater Sunrise will provide new opportunities for income, and commercial and industrial development in Timor-Leste, and is an important part of Timor-Leste\u2019s economic future. As Timor-Leste celebrates the 20th anniversary of its independence as a sovereign nation this year, Australia remains steadfast in our support for Timor-Leste\u2019s prosperity and role in the Indo-Pacific, and our friendship with the Timorese people.

July 24, 2019 20. \u2018Raise the Rate of Newstart fact check\u2019. Australian Council of Social Services. July 22, 2019 That fact check continued: The most recent Social Services department data, dated December 2018, captures the number of people receiving Newstart benefits. The \u201cPayment Duration\u201d table shows the average payment duration for all people on Newstart in December 2018 was 156 weeks or three years. [16] The Payment Duration table shows that of all the 722,923 people getting Newstart in December 2018, 241,415 or 33% received it for under one year, almost 18% or 128,139 were on the payment for one to two years, 200,196 or 27% were on it for two to five years, just over 17% or 125,408 people had been on the benefit for between five and 10 years and 27,765 or just under 4% had been getting it for over 10 years. This table shows about 66% of people on Newstart were receiving the benefit for between one to 10 years. [16] Another table in the same data document titled \u201cExits 12 months\u201d shows the number of people who began receiving Newstart between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017. This 2017 table shows there were 376,031 people who started receiving Newstart in 2017. Of this 2017 group, 236,530 exited within 12 months or 63 per cent. [16] This table supports the claim that two thirds of people on Newstart existed within 12 months but only for 2017. A July 25, 2019 investigation by Crikey using Department of Social Services data found \u201cthe proportion of Newstart recipients on payments for more than a year climbed from 69% in 2014, to 73% in 2016 and to 76.5% in 2018. [17] The Guardian Australia found on July 23 that the government was using select Newstart payment data between January-December 2017 to support its claim. [18] The Conversation found on July 24, 2019, the contradiction between the government\u2019s claim that most people who enter Newstart quickly leave compared to most people on Newstart who have been on it for a long time, was the difference between flow and stock. It found most Newstart recipients had to survive on Newstart long-term and \u201cat any one time the overwhelming majority of the people\u201d on Newstart had \u201cbeen on it for more than a year\u201d. [19] The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) has also disputed the government\u2019s claim stating: \u201ctwo thirds of people receiving Newstart have received the payment for 12 months or more\u201d. [20] Based on this evidence AAP FactCheck found the claim that \u201ctwo thirds of Newstart recipients end that payment within 12 months,\u201d made by ministers McKenzie, Frydenberg, Dutton, Cormann and Fletcher, plus senators Askew and Stoker and Wentworth MP Dave Sharma, to be false. The correct number of people who have ceased receiving Newstart within 12 months was one third, according to Department of Social Services\u2019 ongoing data, not two thirds as government ministers claimed. The government\u2019s claim is only true when referring to the number of people who started and exited Newstart in the 2017 calendar year. The Verdict Mostly False - The checkable claim is mostly false, with one minor element of truth. AAP has done a fact check on the claim that \u201ctwo thirds of Newstart recipients end that payment within 12 months\u201d, a statement made by Bridget McKenzie, Mathias Cormann, Dave Sharma, Wendy Askew, Peter Dutton, Amanda Stoker, Josh Frydenberg and Paul Fletcher. AAP FactCheck examined Senator McKenzie\u2019s claim that two thirds of people on Newstart end that payment within 12 months and found the exact same claim had been repeated by four other government ministers, two senators and a backbencher dating back to April 2019. On July 26, 2019 finance minister Mathias Cormann was quoted as saying: \u201cTwo thirds of people on Newstart allowance are on it for less than a year, it is not designed to be an ongoing payment,\u201d he said. [3] The federal member for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, made the same claim on Sky TV on July 24, 2019 stating: \u201cTwo thirds of people who are on Newstart have often found employment within 12 months\u201d. [4] During a Senate debate on July 22, 2019, Tasmanian senator Wendy Askew said: \u201caround two-thirds of jobseekers who are granted Newstart exit income support within 12 months\u201d. [5] Home affairs minister Peter Dutton made the same claim on July 19, 2019, stating \u201ctwo-thirds of people come off Newstart within 12 months\u201d. [6] In a Facebook post on May 11, 2019 addressing criticism the Newstart Allowance wasn\u2019t increased in the budget, Senator Amanda Stoker stated \u201cAround two thirds of those granted Newstart exit income support within 12 months\u201d. [7] Treasurer Josh Frydenberg repeated the same line on May 6, 2019, stating \u201cthe other thing about Newstart is two-thirds of the people come off within 12 months and go into a job\u201d. [8] Former social services minister, now communications minister Paul Fletcher, was quoted as saying \u201caround two-thirds of those on Newstart exited income support within 12 months\u201d on April 30, 2019. [9] The Newstart Allowance is an income support payment for people aged from 22 but under Age Pension age who are actively looking for work. [10] Singles with no children get a maximum of $278 per week/$555.70 per fortnight - or about $40 a day, while couples receive a maximum $251 each per week/$501.1 per fortnight. [11] The payment has not increased in real terms for 25 years. [12] Former prime minister John Howard, former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, minister for resources and Northern Australia Matt Canavan, Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos and a number of Coalition backbenchers have joined Labor and the Greens in calling for the government to raise the benefit. [13] [14] Prime minister Scott Morrison has stated he\u2019d rather give a welfare boost to pensioners than the unemployed. [15] A spokesperson for Senator McKenzie advised AAP FactCheck the source of her claim was data.gov.au, the central source of Australian open government data. Adam Bandt raised this in question time, but that is about as much as we have heard on this today. From Bandt\u2019s office: Greens Member for Melbourne Adam Bandt MP said today that the prime minister failed to assure the House that none of his ministers had lobbied on behalf of Crown casino, in breach of his Ministerial Code of Conduct, and that no Home Affairs officials had acted improperly. Last night\u2019s 60 Minutes report and recent reporting in The Age/Sydney Morning Herald has claimed a senior Home Affairs official was lobbied by several members of parliament, including two ministers, to help fast-track visas and airport entry for Crown high rollers. \u201cThese reports are very concerning and the prime minister has refused to assure the House that none of his ministers acted improperly,\u201d said Mr Bandt. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s response is not good enough. He cannot wash his hands of this. He must to get to the bottom of whether his ministers and the Home Affairs Department have been involved in this scandal and report to the parliament about what action his government will take.\u201d Greens democracy spokesperson, Senator Larissa Waters, said: \u201cThis is why we need an anti-corruption body. The ministerial standards are routinely ignored. The PM had a chance in both Houses of Parliament today to outline the investigations he is undertaking in relation to these latest alleged breaches and the answer was nothing. The PM refused to answer whether the ministers implicated are still in cabinet and confirmed that the Coalition has received almost $700,000 in donations from Crown since 2012. \u201cPublic confidence in our democracy is being consistently eroded by the actions of this self-interested and greedy government. It\u2019s time for an Icac now, with broad powers to investigate dodgy conduct including of ministers of the crown.\u201d The Senate has passed a motion criticising the government\u2019s decision to include funding for couples counselling as part of $10 million program to tackle family violence. Guardian Australia reported at the weekend that women\u2019s safety groups had raised concerns about the Specialised Family Violence Services package, which was announced in the budget. The Greens deputy leader, Larissa Waters, said the government had acted against the advice of experts in the field and the money should go to specialist domestic and family violence services, rather than faith-based family relationship services. \u201cFrontline services desperately need more funding,\u201d she said. The motion called on the government to \u201censure [survivors are] not forced to undergo counselling with perpetrators\u201d, a claim which the social services minister, Anne Ruston, said was \u201cmisleading\u201d. Ruston said providers did not force survivors to undergo counselling with perpetrators. \u201cThe government believes we should provide a wide range of services to encourage women to come forward,\u201d she said. The Guardian found nearly half of the organisations invited to apply for the funding were religious-based. Larissa Waters moved a motion for the production of documents related to this in the Senate: That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Prime Minister and Leader of the Government in the Senate, by 31 July 2019, the following documents: any \u2018constituent\u2019 correspondence or other document sent to the Member for Hume, Mr Taylor, requesting action in relation to the listing of Natural Temperate Grassland of the South Eastern Highlands ecological community, as referred to by Senator Patrick in the Senate on 25 July 2019; any correspondence between the Federal Government and Senator Patrick in relation to any proposed inquiry into the actions of Mr Taylor and Mr Frydenberg. That did get up. And the Senate has just passed Kristina Keneally\u2019s motion, with the review due to be produced by Wednesday. Remember that strategic review into Home Affairs we reported on a little bit ago? The one that was completed, but not released? Kristina Keneally is trying to get a motion up in the Senate for the production of those documents. Malcolm Roberts is complaining about the UN interfering with Australia\u2019s sovereignty. So situation normal in the Senate. Labor\u2019s motion calling for Angus Taylor to be referred to a Senate inquiry has been lost by one vote. Ayes: Labor, the Greens, Rex Patrick*, Jacqui Lambie. Noes: Coalition, Cory Bernardi, Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation. Ayes 32 Noes 33 *just amending this. Stirling Griff abstained. How Mike Bowers spent some of his time in the chamber. Taking note of answers after question time, Labor has sent Penny Wong, Kim Carr and Deborah O\u2019Neil into the attack against Angus Taylor. Wong told the Senate that it appeared Taylor had used his ministerial position \u201cto shore his investments up\u201d: He failed to declare a direct financial interest in a company, then used his position as a minister to defend that company\u2019s interest after it was accused of breaking the law. Earlier, in question time, Simon Birmingham gave an \u201cemphatic no\u201d to Wong\u2019s suggestion that Taylor had sought special treatment and received it. Wong said Taylor\u2019s statement to parliament had failed to \u201cprovide any evidence he was representing anybody\u2019s interests but himself\u201d. She dismissed a letter from a constituent three years prior to Taylor seeking a meeting with the environment department \u2013 because he didn\u2019t act on it at the time \u2013 a letter that came six months after the meeting and \u201ca conversation with a bloke from Yass\u201d. Taylor \u201cmagically, coincidentally\u201d got a meeting with the environment department a day after the department met with Jam Land on the compliance matter, Wong said. As we heard in question time, Taylor and the department maintain that the compliance matter was not raised at the meeting. New senators National Susan McDonald and Liberal Claire Chandler were then sent in to defend Taylor. McDonald accused Labor of acting \u201cas if there is only one farmer in Australia\u201d and defends Taylor\u2019s explanation he was representing constituents by arguing there had been concern about the grass classification issue \u201cfor some time\u201d. The Senate still hasn\u2019t voted on the Angus Taylor inquiry motion \u2013 that is coming up in just a bit, but it will be lost. Russell Broadbent just delivered a statement to the House, claiming to have been misrepresented. He has not called for an increase to the Newstart allowance. Just so you know. Scott Morrison walks over to Angus Taylor on the bench and gives him a nod to walk out with him. Subtle. Scott Morrison nods to David Littleproud, letting him know that he will get the last dixer and then stacks his papers, the international signal that question time is about to end. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I again refer to his earlier answers and to the letter from farm organisations dated 3 October 2017. Given the minister refused to answer, I ask again, is the single alleged EPBCC breach in that letter the alleged poisoning of critically endangered grass on his lands? Angus Taylor: That is the same question and it gets the same answer. Rebekha Sharkie to Sussan Ley: On 26 October 2018 I joined local conservation groups in writing to the secretariat of the UN convention on the wetlands of international importance about the lower lakes site. Our letter constituted an article 3.2 notification and requires the government to respond within three months to a detailed questionnaire and what measures have been put in place to rectify the deterioration. Would the minister please advise the House of the government\u2019s response? Ley: Can I thank the member for Mayo for her question and her keen interest in the [site] which is a vital part of her electorate, and indicate the letter she refers to was received before I was sworn in as environment minister. The convention, as she notes, is an international convention on the conservation of wetlands, particularly when it comes to the habitat of water birds. I\u2019m very happy to follow up where that information is and get back to the member. And that, is how dixers SHOULD be used. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to his earlier answers and the letters from farm organisations dated 3 October 2017. Is the single alleged EPBCC breach referenced in that letter alleging poisoning of critically endangered grassland on the minister\u2019s land? Taylor: The environment is not my portfolio responsibility. I have no idea how you expect me to answer that question. This is the ongoing contempt and disdain you show for the farmers of this country. Scott Morrison\u2019s papers are not stacked. Which means we have some dixers to get through. Labor is asking Senate questions about \u201clawbreaking Liberal construction boss Gerry Hanssen\u201d, citing breaches by his company for \u201cexploiting migrant workers\u201d and a fine of Hanssen personally for refusing union officials entry to a work site. Labor senator Louise Pratt asks why the Liberal party won\u2019t eject him as a member. The finance minister Mathias Cormann says that the government \u201ccondemns all breaches of workplace laws\u201d \u2013 by employers or unions \u2013 and Hanssen was \u201cappropriately subject to court proceedings\u201d. Cormann accuses Labor of attempting to suggest \u201can equivalence of the actions of Hansen with John Setka to distract from their failure to eject him from the Labor party\u201d. Labor senators interject \u2013 asking if the government will push to deregister his companies. Christian Porter with your daily dose of just how safe you are: unions are terrible is up now. Tony Burke to Angus Taylor: Can the minister confirm that his statements to the parliament now offer three reasons for why he held a meeting with the Department of the Environment in 2017. One, somebody wrote a letter six months after the meeting that was addressed to somebody else. Two, somebody wrote a letter three years before the meeting that was addressed to somebody else and, three, he had a conversation with a bloke in Yass. Isn\u2019t the only consistent interest here his own? Angus Taylor: That question shows the disdain that those opposite have for the farmers of Australia. The contempt they have for the farmers of Australia. Well, I\u2019ll always back our farmers. I will always back our farmers. I do it every day, Mr Speaker, and I refer to the comments that I made in my comprehensive and detailed statement earlier today. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister\u2019s previous answers. Is it just a coincidence that the consultant who gave the go-ahead to spray critically endangered grasslands on the minister\u2019s land also advised the authors of the letter about so-called problems with the listing? Taylor: I have already made a comprehensive and detailed statement to the House earlier today, where I made clear that my focus in my work as the member for Hume \u2026 was the technical aspects of the listing and ensuring that farmers get a fair deal under this listing. That was my focus. And that remains my focus and that is my job. Because there are only two people in this parliament who have regions covered by this, and only one was ever gonna advocate for the farmers across that region and that was me, Mr Speaker. But the question is ... the question ... the question I want to know is, what have those opposite got against hard-working farmers? What have they got against hard-working farmers? Because we have seen in this place now a targeted and deliberate approach from those opposite not just to demonise them but to fail to support them when it counts. Just last week they voted against the government\u2019s drought fund which would help farmers when they\u2019re doing it tough. This is a vital fund. (Labor voted for the fund) Paul Fletcher is STILL ON YOUR SIDE. But really, his delivery is so...ravishingly engaging, it\u2019s hard to pay attention to the words. But trust us. HE IS ON YOUR SIDE Angus Taylor, on the question of whether he received any correspondence from any constituents about the grasslands listing: Whilst the question may not be identical, I have clearly answered the question in my previous answer. And I said in my statement earlier today, late 2016-17 I spoke with a series of farmers across my electorate and elsewhere about the concerns they had. And they pointed me ... to the 2014 submission from the National Farmers\u2019 Federation. And I go on, on this submission. This submission is very important because it captured the concerns of the farmers. It said, \u2018Based on the information provided in the NFF\u2019s view it is highly unlikely that an individual farmer would be able to assess their responsibilities under the EPBC.\u2019 So this is a listing where the farmers were in a situation where they were not able to assess whether efficient pasture improvement and weed management could indeed be compliant. That is a very real concern for people who farm, and we understand farming on this side of the House. But I think what those opposite are actually suggesting ... should be named and there is a very important piece of legislation going in front of this parliament in the coming weeks where there is an opportunity for you to decide whether naming farmers, naming farmers, in the face of activism, should be permitted. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister\u2019s earlier answers. Did the minister receive a single letter from any constituent about the grasslands listing prior to his meeting with the Department of Environment in March 2017? Christian Porter: The member is relying on previous answers to ask that question, and the minister has just noted that in his answers and statement there is no reference to correspondence, which is what [they are] seeking to have tabled or answered. Tony Smith: I have to say to the leader of the house, whilst he may well be factually right, that doesn\u2019t prevent the question being asked. It\u2019s not an identical question. The only problem it would have would be if it was an identical question, and it\u2019s not. Don\u2019t look back in anger Another dixer on finding out how the Morrison government is ON YOUR SIDE. Seriously. If the parliamentary procedures committee doesn\u2019t come back with a DEATH TO DIXERS rule, you\u2019ll be able to hear my scream in Cairns. Angus Taylor: In my statement earlier today in the House, I said that in late 2016 and early 2017 I spoke with farmers \u2026 in Goulburn in my electorate and Yass, which had been in Hume until mid-2016, about this listing and their concerns about the listing. ... On 21 February 2017 I spoke with a farmer near Yass who expressed strong and detailed concerns about the revised listing, pointing out that it had occurred despite the concerns of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and the New South Wales Farmers Federation and with little consultation with the farmers themselves. And referring back to the letter from the National Farmers\u2019 Federation to the department back in 2014, they laid out very clearly that the proposed adjustment to the listing typifies the frustration of the farm sector in relation to the listings under the EPBBC and they made it very clear that the evidence supporting the listing is not sufficiently robust. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister\u2019s earlier answers. Will the minister table any correspondence about the grasslands listing from constituents received prior to his meeting with the Department of Environment and energy in March 2017? Taylor: I have already made a comprehensive and detailed statement in the House earlier today. And I tell you that the frustration of the farmers with this listing was clear. In 2014, in a table that I documented earlier today as part of that comprehensive statement, the national farmers federation ... Anthony Albanese interrupts to say the question was about constituent correspondence, not the 2014 NFF submission. Tony Smith says it has only been 30 seconds. Christian Porter says any letters from constituents is not relevant to his current portfolio. Tony Burke points out that Taylor brought up the letters himself. Porter says he hasn\u2019t heard any reference to those letters. Smith: Really, the ... point the manager of opposition business made is right. Once a \u2013 and I have ruled that way several times. Once a \u2013 a minister can\u2019t be questioned about any of their previous portfolio responsibilities until such time as they address them, and once that\u2019s been done, and that\u2019s why questions do refer to the minister\u2019s previous answers, and I have ruled numerous times in accordance with those precedents. So, I think it\u2019s fine for the question to be asked but obviously the manner in which it\u2019s been asked, it\u2019s a matter for the minister how he seeks to deal with that. Angus Taylor is also on your side. And also on the side of big sticks. Or maybe toothpicks. It is hard to keep up with where that landed before the election. Either way, sticks are back. I\u2019m pleased to say that we will be bringing forward later this year the big-stick legislation that those opposite have voted against 13 times in this parliament. Mr Speaker, this legislation is vital to ensuring that we have another tool in the toolkit to maintain supply in the market and drive prices down, because we saw in 2016, as a result of the reckless targets of the Victorian Labor government, the exit of the Hazelwood power station, and the mere announcement of that exit saw a doubling of wholesale prices in Victoria. Since then we have seen in Victoria, as a result of the exit of Hazelwood, prices hiking and lights going out. 200,000 Victorian households and businesses lost their power last summer. And despite the clear failure of that policy, and a similar policy from the previous South Australian Labor government, Mr Speaker, those opposite want to role this policy out nationally, Mr Speaker, nationally. During the last election we saw independent modelling telling us that doing so would double wholesale prices of electricity and triple the price of gas. We on this side of the House sit on the side of a fair deal for the hard-working small businesses and households of Australia. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister\u2019s earlier answer claiming that a letter from farm organisations dated 3 October 2017 proves he was making constituent representations when he sought a meeting with the Department of the Environment and Energy six months prior. How did the minister seek a meeting as a result of a letter that didn\u2019t exist until six months later? Taylor: I have already made a comprehensive and detailed statement on this matter covering exactly this issue to the House earlier today and in that statement I made clear that through discussions with farmers in late 2016 and 2017, they demonstrated deep concerns about the impact of this listing on their farming operation. And they pointed me to a National Farmers\u2019 Federation submission made in 2014 expressing those concerns. 2014. Expressing those concerns about the impact of this listing on our farmers. But let\u2019s be clear. Let\u2019s be clear. ... Let\u2019s be clear about what this is about. Those opposite just want to smear farmers and those who represent farmers in this place because they are completely out of touch with farmers. We saw at the last election those opposite take policies to that election which would mean rolling out the draconian native vegetation laws in Queensland as state laws across Australia and in the process undermine the productivity and success of one of the great industries that has been the backbone of this country for so long, Mr Speaker. I will speak up for farmers every day in this place. That\u2019s what we do on this side of the House. Michael Sukkar is giving a lesson in merit in this next dixer. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: How many of the 76 recommendations from the banking royal commission has the government fully implemented? Frydenberg: I can inform the House that we have already legislated recommendation 3.6, which will prohibit superannuation funds inducing employees. We have recommended and legislated through this place recommendation 3.7, which introduces civil penalties for trustees and directors of super funds. We have already introduced and passed regulations which extend Apra\u2019s remit for financial comments to 2008. We have passed regulations to ensure greater cooperation with Apra is legislated ... we have with the states and territories to develop a national approach. We announced a ... review into Apra and we have accepted the recommendations from that Apra review. Mr Speaker, we have announced in the budget $649 million extra funding for Asic and Apra, which is 25 % to 30% increase. We\u2019re extending the jurisdictions of the federal court to include criminal jurisdiction, and the list goes on. Now, Mr Speaker ... There were 76 recommendations. Mr Speaker, the other side are a complete joke. The other side are a complete joke. They took 22 days to respond. We took four days. And we\u2019re getting on with the job of legislating past regulations, doing it carefully so no mistakes are made. This is a critically important area. When it comes to an organisation like Apra, in Labor\u2019s last year in office, funding actually decreased not increased. ... We have passed legislation, passed regulations and are getting on with the job of protecting Australian consumers. Labor is probing the Angus Taylor grassland issue in Senate question time, asking if there is only one \u201ccompliance action\u201d for breaching environmental rules on grasslands in the region \u2013 and whether it relates to land owned by Taylor. Simon Birmingham, representing Taylor in the Senate, points to the statement the energy and emissions reduction minister made in the lower house. Birmingham: \u201c[Taylor] has not engaged in discussions about compliance actions, he has represented his electorate in matters brought to him by constituents ... If there is information about further compliance matters, I will bring it to the attention of the chamber.\u201d Wong notes this appears to confirm there was only one compliance action. There follows several points of order on relevance, and Wong passively aggressively calls Birmo \u201cmate\u201d. Birmingham says the ownership structure of Taylor\u2019s interests is \u201con the public record\u201d. \u201cThrough you Mr President \u2013 mate \u2013 he\u2019s been very clear about its ownership.\u201d Josh Frydenberg is also on your side. Adam Bandt has the independent question today: Reports have emerged that a wanted criminal wasn\u2019t arrested when he first landed in Australia and his plane was recently searched on the tarmac but allowed to leave the country, even though an Interpol notice was in forced. It\u2019s also been reported that he got money and special treatment from Crown casino and ministers have lobbied Home Affairs to ensure high rollers can fly into the country, drive to Crown casino with a minimal amount of clearances. Can you assure none of your [ministers] lobbied \u2026 which would breach your ministerial Code of Conduct. Can you also guarantee no Home Affairs officials have acted improperly in those matters? Scott Morrison: I thank the Member for Melbourne for his question. It is a very serious topic and deals with the integrity not only of our gaming industry but issues that go to law enforcement and border protection. And I welcome the Member for Melbourne\u2019s interest in this topic. Our government takes allegations of illegal activity very seriously. Everyone is required to abide by Australian law, including casino operators, public officials, all visitors to our country. Our law enforcement agencies are working hard to disrupt criminal groups [involved in] financially motivated crime. While I can\u2019t go into the details of that for obvious reasons which would be known to the member, these investigations are ongoing and will continue. In relation to the specific matters that were raised by the member, there has been nothing presented to me that would indicate there are any matters there for me to address. Anthony Albanese to Josh Frydenberg: I refer to his previous answer. Is annual wages growth now better or worse than when his government came to office? Frydenberg: Growth is 2.3 % and wages continue to go up. Llew O\u2019Brien summons Michael McCormack to the despatch box. Moving on. Peter Dutton is not in the chamber \u2013 he\u2019s in the UK for a meeting with the Five Eyes partners. That leaves Christian Porter to deliver the JUST HOW SAFE YOU ARE segment today. Jim Rankin to Josh Frydenberg: Why does the government support cutting penalty rates when the Reserve Bank says that stagnant wages are a key contributor to slowing growth in the economy? Frydenberg: We don\u2019t support cutting penalty rates but we do support an independent arbitor, and it\u2019s taken 53 questions from those opposite for the member for Rankin to get a question to the treasurer. \u201cTell us about wages growth,\u201d someone from Labor yells out. \u201cLabor, Labor, Labor, Labor,\u201d Ed Husic yells, as Frydenberg talks about when Labor was last in office. That was six years ago. Labor leader in the Senate Penny Wong has just accused the government of filibustering an obscure bill about the East Timor maritime sea boundary, despite ministers Marise Payne and Matt Canavan asking Labor to help secure \u201cspeedy passage\u201d of the bill. Wong cites the addition to the speaking list of Dean Smith, Slade Brockman, Andrew Bragg and Paul Scarr. Labor thinks the government is stalling because it risks running out of business or faces hostile Jacqui Lambie amendments to a veterans bill. Wong: \u201cWith all due respect to the senator, [Dean] Smith, because he is very well spoken and can speak at short notice, but it is very clear the government is seeking to delay the passage of this bill before question time. [The ministers] owe the Senate an explanation why we were asked to facility speedy passage and you\u2019re now filibustering it.\u201d Senator Jane Hume insists there has been \u201cno delay\u201d, it\u2019s just the government senators have something \u201csignificant\u201d to say. Smith then argues it is important for every senator to make a contribution if they wish. Smith then refers to himself in the third person, explaining that \u201cSenator Smith\u2019s\u201d state of Western Australia shares a maritime boundary with East Timor. We\u2019re now into question time. Scott Morrison takes the first dixer. He\u2019s super on your side. Labor and the Greens, along with the Senate crossbench, have voted to investigate how much Newstart should be increased by and how much that would cost. Scott Morrison: The best form of welfare is a job, that\u2019s what those on this side of the House believe and I believe Australians believe and I want to commend all those Australians who are on Newstart and looking for a job. Our government won\u2019t rest until we get them all into jobs. That\u2019s the pledge we made at the last [election] \u2026 1.25 million new jobs over the last few years and that\u2019s on the \u2026 over 1 million jobs created since we came to government. I\u2019m asked about the rate of Newstart, $555 a fortnight. But on average an additional $153.50 is paid a fortnight to recipients and some 99%, I am advised, receive payments over and above Newstart. But what I tell you, what I won\u2019t do when it comes to Newstart in this place, I will not engage in the unfunded empathy of the Labor party. I will not go out as the Labor party did at the last election, pretending they\u2019re going to do something about Newstart, but they won\u2019t tell Australians how much they\u2019re going to increase it by, how much is that going to cost and how are they going to pay for it. I won\u2019t do that. Our government has set priorities on investing in health, in schools, on education, on mental health, on combating the terrible curse of suicide in our country, supporting our veterans. We have made those choices about priorities rather than increasing the size of the welfare budget. At the last election the Labor party came up with $387 billion of higher taxes and they still didn\u2019t come up with a way to fund an increase in the Newstart allowance. I will not allow this Labor opposition to go out and make all sorts of promises to Australians about Newstart when they have no intention of funding it and no intention of backing it up with a real policy. Sharon Bird to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. Could the prime minister live on the Newstart rate of $40 a day? \u201cOf course he couldn\u2019t,\u201d calls out Anne Aly. Morrison: I thank the member for her question and, like all of those who are on Newstart or many of the other welfare payments that are provided to them by the taxpayer, those payments are certainly modest, Mr Speaker. And those payments are indexed every six months, along with every other welfare payment, and the Australian public provides that support. But the most important support that is provided by this government is to ensure that people can get off welfare and work, and this government has, and this government has set records both for youth unemployment, getting people into jobs, people across the spectrum, older Australians, younger, female Australians, getting them into work, because the best form of welfare is ... Tony Burke calls a point of order on relevance. Tony Smith says he has reviewed direct relevance, and he is relying on Harry Jenkins\u2019s ruling on a Julia Gillard answer ruling: \u2018So far I believe she\u2019s been directly relevant if not giving a direct answer. And they are different things. The standing orders demand direct relevance\u2019, and he then went on, I think, as the leader of the opposition would remember, to say if there\u2019s going to be any other changes the procedure committee needed to look at it, etc, etc. But I think that\u2019s the principle I\u2019m sticking with. So he\u2019ll listen to Morrison and make sure he remains relevant, but it is not for him to say how he answers the question. Scott Morrison has entered the chamber with Angus Taylor. That\u2019s a deliberate statement. Perhaps the prime minister is ambitious for Taylor. The government appears to be adding speakers to the maritime boundaries legislation. Senators, of course, are able to speak on whatever legislation they would like, as are MPs. But adding MPs to this one, given its support, has Labor smelling a filibuster. Why? Well, it\u2019s discuss legislation, or move on to the Governor-Address-In-Reply, which is what happens when the Senate runs out of legislation to discuss. The union bill probably won\u2019t make it to the Senate today, because Labor will most likely hold it up in the House by adding as many speakers as it can to the list \u2013 one, because Labor is against it, and two, because it gives Labor an opportunity to point out the lack of legislation in the Senate. Who is that MP? It was Ted O\u2019Brien. It\u2019s the downhill slide into question time. Angus Taylor has attempted to get in ahead with his statement. Will it work? Hit me up with your predictions. And the beginning of the statement, which I originally missed: First, Mr Speaker, I want to address the matter of my declaration of interests. I am required by the rules of this place to disclose my shareholdings. My Register of Member\u2019s Interests discloses my shareholdings in my family company, Gufee Pty Ltd. I am required by the rules of this place to disclose any partnerships I am part of. My Register of Member\u2019s Interests discloses Gufee\u2019s interest in Farm Partnerships Australia. This is a legal partnership set up with my three brothers and a business associate over twenty years ago to farm across this region, close to where I stand now, via leased, managed and owned farms. We originally set it up to work with ageing and absentee farmers, to allow them to continue to living on, and owning their farms, beyond their ability to farm themselves. This farming partnership \u2013 a common legal structure for rural holdings \u2013 has in recent years held a one third interest in a farm near Delegate in South Eastern NSW If the Register of Interests were required to record minority, non-controlling interests held at three levels down in a family company structure, this would be a major change to the current practice. For instance, investments made by public companies held by members would need to be disclosed. It would require changes in disclosures for many in this place, including for those opposite. I therefore have fully met my obligations to declare my interests in Gufee and Farm Partnerships Australia. Mr Speaker, I turn to the revised EPBC listing, the natural temperate grasslands of the Southern Tablelands Ecological Community. In late 2016 and early 2017 I spoke with farmers from Boorowa and Goulburn in my electorate, and Yass which had been in Hume until mid 2016, about this listing and their concerns with the listing. On 21 February 2017, I spoke with a farmer near Yass who expressed strong and detailed concerns about the revised listing, pointing out that it had occurred despite the concerns of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and NSW Farmers, and with little consultation with farmers themselves. All of these farmers were completely disconnected from our family farming operations. Angus Taylor continues: Officials in attendance were determined by the department. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the facts are clear and straightforward: \u00b7 My interests have been declared in complete adherence to the rules. \u00b7 I have had no association with the events leading to the compliance action that has been the subject of these allegations, and I have never made a representation in relation to it. I never would. All available information supports my repeated statements that the compliance action was never raised. \u00b7 My focus was advocating for the interests of the farmers in my electorate and across the region. This is my job as the elected representative for Hume with a large farming population and agriculture sector Mr Speaker, I am proud to represent the interests of farmers - the backbone of so many regional communities. I will continue to do this at every opportunity. Angus Taylor: There has been strong antagonism expressed by the farming community about federal and state native vegetation regulation for some time. The concern was very serious. The revised listing requires farmers to assess whether there is 50% native vegetation down to parcels of one-tenth of a hectare and highly unfavourable times of year, because clover, an introduced species, must be excluded from the assessment. The revised listing extends beyond most of my electorate\u2019s farming country, both pre and post the 2016 redistribution, as well as much of Eden-Monaro. It goes well beyond NSW regulations, and is costly and unmanageable, as it is difficult or impossible to be sure that routine pasture improvement, or weed management, is compliant. The revised listing would ultimately halt pasture improvement and efficient weed control across the southern tablelands and Monaro. It has the potential to do untold damage to agriculture productivity throughout the region, undermining the livelihoods of 2500 people who work in agriculture in my electorate. On the 21st of February 2017, at the suggestion of the Yass farmer, I contacted the policy director of the NSW Farmers\u2019 Association, who provided me with their June 2014 submission to the then department of environment, expressing serious concerns about the proposed revised listing. On the basis of these concerns, I sought a briefing on the revised listing from the then-ministers office, which I made clear was not to include any discussion of compliance matters. This has already been confirmed by departmental documents released to journalists under FOI in which an official writes in internal correspondence, that the meeting with me was, and I quote \u2018to answer questions on the technical aspects of the listing outcome and highlights that they would stay out of completely any compliance action under way\u2019. The official also writes, and I quote, \u2018we will confine discussion to the EPBC Act listing process\u2019. On the 20th March 2017, I attended the meeting. At no time during this meeting was any compliance matter or any personal interest of mine discussed. At that meeting we discussed precisely what the departmental official said we would discuss. Christian Porter is attempting to have this dealt with tomorrow, while Adam Bandt is asking the House to deal with it immediately. The government has the numbers. He says all the available information backs up what he is saying, and he has never been involved in the compliance action. \u201cMy interests have been declared in complete adherence to the rules,\u201d Angus Taylor says. Angus Taylor is making a statement in the House about the grasslands issue. So far, the government is not budging, in terms of policy, on raising Newstart. This was Scott Morrison on July 18: It\u2019s about getting people into jobs. The latest jobs figures show 20,000 additional full-time jobs. That\u2019s good news, that\u2019s great news, more jobs. How good are jobs. At the moment, Newstart is only slated to rise by the usual indexation increase. The Senate is getting down to the government business of the day: That\u2019s pretty definitive, but will also be used by Pauline Hanson to gain support from her supporters. Just the standard Cornelian dilemma thrown up by the Senate This is very interesting: On ensuring integrity: Barnaby Joyce on Sunrise this morning: I wouldn\u2019t have picked the headline \u2018I\u2019m skint\u2019. I would have said, you know, I have a greater empathy for what people are going through on Newstart. Someone has got to speak up for them and so often, Nat, if you say, you know, we have to do a better deal for these people and people say, \u201cHow would you know? You\u2019re a politician.\u201d A lot of people, I suppose, hate to really talk about it but I have to because of the front page. In a marriage breakdown you go from supporting one family to supporting two, in many instances. And here are his comments in the Courier-Mail, which kickstarted all of this: I\u2019m just saying these circumstances have made me more vastly attuned \u2026 it\u2019s just a great exercise in humility going from deputy prime minister to watching every dollar you get. A politician [renting a duplex without a dishwasher] for 415 bucks a week, he\u2019s not living high on the hog, is he? There is a reason for that and that\u2019s basically what I can afford. You do become a lot more mindful. So the big thrill of the day, to be honest, is a cup of coffee. We [he and Vikki] rarely, if ever, go out for dinner. Because 2019 is the new 2004, Pauline Hanson wants to make the next election about immigration numbers. Let\u2019s look at the numbers, shall we? The government has announced an immigration target of 160,000. That is no change from what is actually happening, because in the last year, despite a high ceiling of 190,000, just 162,000 permanent residents were accepted in Australia. Over that same period, Australia\u2019s economy grew by just 1.8%. Low, but growth is growth. Of that, about 94% of growth was attributed to population growth \u2013 our economy grew because of the extra people in it. Total per capita growth was 0.1%. Without migrants, Australia\u2019s economy goes backwards. The government knows that. It\u2019s why it dances a line between cutting immigration and just keeping things at the status quo. But hey \u2013 it gets breakfast TV headlines, so let\u2019s dance. The Australian is reporting that #deathtodixers is gathering steam. OK, it is not that specific. But Greg Brown has some detail on the parliamentary procedures committee: The conduct of federal parliament\u2019s question time \u2014 including Dorothy Dixers, the behaviour of MPs and arcane standing orders \u2014 will be the subject of an inquiry, amid warnings from across the political spectrum that it diminishes the reputation of politicians. Coalition and Labor MPs on the parliament\u2019s procedures committee will this week finalise the terms of an inquiry of how question time can be reformed, with submissions to be sought from the public. Liberal National MP Ross Vasta and Labor MP Milton Dick, the chairman and deputy chairman of the committee, said the community was \u201cfed up\u201d with the spectacle of question time, which is the only part of parliament that is televised every sitting day. The inquiry will examine whether Dixers \u2014 prearranged questions from government backbenchers to ministers \u2014 should be axed. The government\u2019s big push this week, ahead of the five-week break, will be unions, with the ensuring integrity bill to dominate much of the debate. So far, the numbers are not there in the Senate. One Nation has concerns, Centre Alliance wants to expand the definition of organisation to include the private sector and Jackie Lambie isn\u2019t thrilled with John Setka, but hasn\u2019t landed on a final position as yet. Christian Porter spoke to RN this morning about it. Katharine Murphy has spoken to Cory Bernardi over whether he will support the motion to launch a Senate inquiry into Angus Taylor and the grasslands issue and says he has decided to vote no. So that\u2019s that then \u2013 the numbers are not there. The bells are ringing \u2013 parliament is about to begin. This is the last sitting before the winter break. Come Thursday, parliament will rise and not return until 9 September. There are five joint sitting weeks left in the year, plus one separate House and Senate sitting. Oh, and as my lovely eyes and ears have pointed out, Barnaby Joyce is also a committee chair (he heads up the employment, education and training committee) which means he gets about an extra $30,000 a year on top of his $211,000. Again, this is without entitlements, including his electorate allowance of $46,000, which he gets to decide how is spent, his travel allowance, or his entitlements. That\u2019s, conservatively, $250,000 a year. Here\u2019s Joyce speaking this morning about his \u201cincredibly good salary\u201d and empathy for those trying to survive on Newstart. Both Labor and the Greens will try to get a motion up in the Senate to launch an inquiry into Angus Taylor over the grasslands issue. You\u2019ll find some context for that here. As Paul Karp reported, Centre Alliance will now back the inquiry, but it is still a few votes short: Labor will continue to target the energy minister, Angus Taylor, as the government\u2019s weak link, citing power price rises since 2015 and renewing its push to set up a Senate inquiry into his meetings with the environment department over endangered grasslands. On Sunday the mooted inquiry took a step forward with Rex Patrick reversing Centre Alliance\u2019s position and pledging to support the move, although Labor and the Greens still need Cory Bernardi or One Nation\u2019s votes to succeed. Pauline Hanson told Sky News this morning she would not support the inquiry: Cory Bernardi is unlikely too. So, unless something major changes, that is dead in the water. And also, let\u2019s not let this story just disappear. Rob Harris\u2019s report in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age that Paul Fletcher, then social services minister, intervened to remove an \u201cincrease Newstart\u201d recommendation in a joint-parliamentary committee was fantastic reporting: A bipartisan call to increase the Newstart allowance was removed from a parliamentary report at the direction of the Morrison government on the eve of the federal election. As prime minister Scott Morrison stares down growing demands by Coalition MPs to lift the unemployment benefit for the first time since 1994, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age can reveal former social services minister Paul Fletcher intervened in an inquiry to erase a major recommendation that would have turbocharged the sensitive issue. And under questioning from Annabel Crabb on Insiders yesterday, Fletcher did not deny it. As Paul Karp reported: Paul Fletcher has repeatedly dodged questions about whether he intervened as social services minister to strike out a committee recommendation to raise the rate of Newstart. On Sunday Fletcher told ABC\u2019s Insiders that the final committee report recommending a review of unemployment benefits was signed off by its members, but did not deny that he caused a stronger call for an increase to be removed. It comes as the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, stares down a push within the Nationals to overturn government policy by commissioning modelling on the economic impact of lifting Newstart. And yes, it is great that politicians (Labor party included) are slowly coming around to the fact that Newstart needs to be increased. But I have a pretty big problem with people who only realise something is a problem when they have their version of a direct experience with it. Barnaby Joyce saying he gets it because he is doing it tough on a great wage like $200,000 is one thing. But that is a figure most of us can only dream of receiving. His life has been one of privilege and his circumstances one of choice. Advocate to raise Newstart. It\u2019s beyond time. It has been more than 20 years since its last real increase and no one can live on $270 a week in this society. Barnaby Joyce also receives $288 a day while he is in Canberra, on top of his wage. Saying he understands, because he too is struggling on his grand wage \u2013 one of the lowest he has received in 14 years in parliament \u2013 and only now that he is struggling, is an insult to those who have only ever known struggle and have never had a chance to rise above their circumstances, because our system is actually built that way. You can have your heart in the right place and still be a shit ally. Like people who say they don\u2019t see colour or gender. That\u2019s something only people who haven\u2019t had colour or gender matter say. Or well-meaning straight LGBTIQ allies who throw \u201ccoming out\u201d straight parties in an attempt to normalise coming out, without considering that it is a lifelong process (it is never a one and done experience) and, for many, terrifying, with far-reaching consequences. So great, advocate for the more vulnerable. But maybe, just maybe, don\u2019t make it about you while you\u2019re doing it. Because more often than not, it isn\u2019t and never has been. And for a comparison, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age did an excellent interactive on what your profession\u2019s median wage is not so long ago. You can also see the Australian Bureau of Statistics report on median earnings here. Let\u2019s just break down some numbers here, as we take in that one of the most privileged men in Australia says he is doing it tough, because he is supporting a child through boarding school, as well as his estranged wife and the family he left, and his new partner and their two infants on *just* $211,000 a year (not counting allowances). As a senator, Barnaby Joyce, who has often said he could make more money as an accountant (a wage we are not counting) made conservatively $199,000 a year between 2005 and 2013. That\u2019s not counting allowances, indexation or committee memberships. That\u2019s just over $1.5m. When he moved to the House of Reps and served as a minister, he conservatively, made $350,00 a year. So there is another $700,000. While deputy prime minister, he made $415,000 a year. So add on another $830,000 (which is quite conservative, but let\u2019s count two years). As a backbencher, he is making a minimum of $211,000. So he has made just under $400,000 on that. So since 2005, Barnaby Joyce has earned, on the most conservative of measures, $3.5m as a politician. This is not counting the $150,000 his partner received for the first televised interview after the birth of their son. AAP has reported on the Newspoll result: Prime minister Scott Morrison is heading into the final parliamentary sitting week ahead of the winter break on the back of a new poll pointing to a lift in his government\u2019s popularity. The Coalition\u2019s primary vote has increased by 2.6% since its May election victory to 44%, according to the Newspoll published by the Australian on Monday. On a two-party-preferred basis, the government now leads Labor 53% to 47%. Morrison also leads Labor leader Anthony Albanese as preferred prime minister at 48% to 31%, while Labor\u2019s primary vote remains largely unchanged at 33%. The Nationals are really covering themselves in glory at the moment, aren\u2019t they. The Coalition\u2019s partner has started the 46th parliament by grabbing the headlines in all the wrong ways \u2013 first, Michael McCormack wanted you to just move to get a job, rather than raise Newstart, because it is apparently that easy. Now, the former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, who does want to raise Newstart, says he \u201cgets it\u201d because he is struggling to make ends meet on $211,000 a year. That\u2019s without allowances. \u201cI\u2019m just saying these circumstances have made me more vastly attuned \u2026 it\u2019s just a great exercise in humility going from deputy prime minister to watching every dollar you get,\u201d he told the Courier-Mail. \u201cA politician [renting a duplex without a dishwasher] for 415 bucks a week, he\u2019s not living high on the hog, is he? \u201cThere is a reason for that and that\u2019s basically what I can afford. You do become a lot more mindful. \u201cSo the big thrill of the day, to be honest, is a cup of coffee. We [he and Vikki] rarely if ever go out for dinner.\u201d Siri \u2013 show me tone deaf. Joyce has since tried to add some context: There are not enough evens to can\u2019t with this one. Meanwhile, Newspoll is back, and the Australian reports a 1.5% swing to the Coalition since the last election with the two-party-preferred measure 53 to 47. I haven\u2019t managed to get a coffee this morning, mostly because I managed to start the week by locking myself out of the house, but I promise to be firing on as many cylinders as I have very soon. Mike Bowers is out and about, and you\u2019ll have Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy to help get you through the day as well. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

Commuters woke up to road closures and diverted trains after parts of Greater Manchester were hit with two weeks\u2019 worth of rain in 24 hours. There were 20 flood warnings in place across north-west England on Monday morning, affecting parts of south Manchester, Rochdale and the Yorkshire market towns of Todmorden and Hebden Bridge. The Environment Agency also issued two flood warnings, advising urgent action, near Nuneaton in Warwickshire and the Leicestershire village of Witherley as the River Anker swelled. Northern Rail said several of its services would be replaced by buses because of the flooding, with trains cancelled between Manchester and towns including Wigan and Stalybridge. The A555 Manchester airport relief road, which opened in October, was closed for the second time in months after it became impassable due to the floods. Fire crews in Preston were called to rescue two people from the River Ribble at 4pm on Sunday. Forecasters said while the heavy rain would clear on Monday, a second band of low pressure will hit the country on Tuesday. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms across much of the south-west and Wales for Tuesday with the risk of floods, lightning strikes, hail and strong winds. Mark Wilson, a Met Office meteorologist, said parts of the south-west and Wales would receive heavy downpours and could get 30-40mm of rain. The average rainfall for the region in July is 81mm, he added. Wilson said: \u201cAn area of low pressure will bring the risk of quite heavy thundery showers into Tuesday. There\u2019s definitely a risk of flooding. Thunderstorms are a concern \u2013 there could be as much as 30mm to 40mm of rain. That\u2019s quite a lot of rain flowing in quite a short period of time.\u201d The Met Office also warned there could be delays and cancellations to trains and buses as well as difficult driving conditions and road closures due to the storms.",

His ascent of the Col de l\u2019Iseran revealed with blinding clarity who was the best mountain goat in what the race organisers billed as the highest Tour.</p> \n<p>Despite the speculation that their dual leadership would lead to a repeat of the tensions that characterised Bradley Wiggins\u2019s relationship with Chris Froome, there was little sign of any rancour throughout the Tour, and Thomas was crestfallen and gracious in defeat.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pleasure to ride with,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put pressure on the lad but he\u2019s 22, he\u2019s got 10 years in front of him, he could become one of the greatest ever. Froome is probably the best Grand Tour rider at the moment with his record and consistency but I think Egan can be just as good, or even improve.\u201d</p> \n<p>In keeping with that statement, the Ineos chief, Dave Brailsford, had already described Bernal as \u201cthe new Chris Froome\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe harder the race gets, the better he gets,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why as a Grand Tour contender now and in the future, the ability to resist fatigue is one of his greatest strengths.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a692ba724d71ae135c4f330136e7406c46a8f57a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a692ba724d71ae135c4f330136e7406c46a8f57a/0_0_3833_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernal crosses the finish line in Paris alongside Ineos teammates Jonathan Castroviejo and Geraint Thomas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernal crosses the finish line in Paris alongside Ineos teammates Jonathan Castroviejo and Geraint Thomas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bernal\u2019s all-round ability, fuelled by his father\u2019s love of cycling and founded in mountain biking, was further honed in Italian racing with the lowly Androni Giacottoli team, managed by renowned talent spotter Gianni Savio. It has now been further enhanced at Ineos, with whom he has a five-year contract.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt 33, 34, Geraint and Chris are coming to the twilight of their careers,\u201d Brailsford said. \u201cI wanted a new Chris Froome, basically. So I set myself the challenge of finding him. I took two years looking at all the younger riders and liked the look of Egan.

This victory can help make that happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>His youth policy, which also includes Tao Geoghegan Hart, Tom Pidcock, Pavel Sivakov, Eddie Dunbar and Ruben Sosa, seems certain to continue the production line of Grand Tour success that has been so lauded and also so controversial.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe focused on recruiting a team of \u2018young guns,\u2019 many of whom rode the Giro this year, and it\u2019s exciting to help them develop and grow whilst also having the A team continuing to push their performance at the highest level.\u201d</p> \n<p>He has now added even more Latin talent to his roster by luring the recent Giro d\u2019Italia winner, Richard Carapaz, to Ineos. The signing is expected to be confirmed next week, when the Ecuadorian joins a team overflowing with stage racing talent.</p> \n<p>The absence of Froome may have diminished the Sky-Ineos aura of invincibility, but tactically Ineos were discreet and opportunistic, managing an indisputably weaker lineup than in past years and exploiting the ambitions of others to secure first and second overall.</p> \n<p>French riders lit up this Tour and without the bravura riding of Julian Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot, particularly in the Pyrenees when Thomas was not at his best, Bernal might not have leapfrogged his teammate to win the race.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d217e323f93af1b9095d8b955a2032c40e2c76ee\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d217e323f93af1b9095d8b955a2032c40e2c76ee/0_0_3500_2215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernal in action in front of the Arc de Triomphe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernal in action in front of the Arc de Triomphe.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Colombian\u2019s instinct to follow Pinot\u2019s accelerations on the Pyrenean summit finishes at the Col du Tourmalet and the climb to Foix Prat d\u2019Albis revealed the gulf in climbing ability between him and Thomas.</p> \n<p>After that it was merely a question of Bernal being given his head and claiming the lead in the Alps. That moment came on the climb of the Col de l\u2019Iseran, which Brailsford described as \u201c37 minutes to win the Tour\u201d.</p> \n<p>For all the talk of panache, flair and romance that characterised this Tour, Brailsford remained Spock-like in his analysis, stating he saw it as a \u201cchallenge of managing logic versus emotion\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis race, more than most, triggered that debate in my head.

      "bodyText": "Egan Bernal\u2019s first bicycle was yellow, a prescient choice given he has become the first Colombian, and one of the youngest riders in history, to win the maillot jaune in the Tour de France. The story of the 22-year-old\u2019s win is the chronicle of a victory foretold, in which the defending champion, Geraint Thomas, was always likely to be second best. As early as stage three to \u00c9pernay, Bernal was straining at the leash, tempted to shatter his team\u2019s meticulous hierarchy by following Julian Alaphilippe as he attacked on the appropriately named Cote de Mutigny. Instead, Bernal sat tight for another two weeks, until the climactic and chaotic Alpine stages, before finally unleashing the devastating climbing speed that reduced his rivals, and his teammate Thomas, to helpless spectators. His ascent of the Col de l\u2019Iseran revealed with blinding clarity who was the best mountain goat in what the race organisers billed as the highest Tour. Despite the speculation that their dual leadership would lead to a repeat of the tensions that characterised Bradley Wiggins\u2019s relationship with Chris Froome, there was little sign of any rancour throughout the Tour, and Thomas was crestfallen and gracious in defeat. \u201cHe\u2019s a pleasure to ride with,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put pressure on the lad but he\u2019s 22, he\u2019s got 10 years in front of him, he could become one of the greatest ever. Froome is probably the best Grand Tour rider at the moment with his record and consistency but I think Egan can be just as good, or even improve.\u201d In keeping with that statement, the Ineos chief, Dave Brailsford, had already described Bernal as \u201cthe new Chris Froome\u201d. \u201cThe harder the race gets, the better he gets,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why as a Grand Tour contender now and in the future, the ability to resist fatigue is one of his greatest strengths.\u201d Bernal\u2019s all-round ability, fuelled by his father\u2019s love of cycling and founded in mountain biking, was further honed in Italian racing with the lowly Androni Giacottoli team, managed by renowned talent spotter Gianni Savio. It has now been further enhanced at Ineos, with whom he has a five-year contract. \u201cAt 33, 34, Geraint and Chris are coming to the twilight of their careers,\u201d Brailsford said. \u201cI wanted a new Chris Froome, basically. So I set myself the challenge of finding him. I took two years looking at all the younger riders and liked the look of Egan. I had to wait a year and then managed to negotiate him out of his contract.\u201d Brailsford\u2019s insatiable appetite for success, that only a few months ago appeared stymied after Sky pulled their sponsorship, has taken another leap forward. \u201cThis is the moment that could make Colombia one of the greatest cycling nations in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cColombia could be to cycling what Brazil is to football. This victory can help make that happen.\u201d His youth policy, which also includes Tao Geoghegan Hart, Tom Pidcock, Pavel Sivakov, Eddie Dunbar and Ruben Sosa, seems certain to continue the production line of Grand Tour success that has been so lauded and also so controversial. \u201cWe focused on recruiting a team of \u2018young guns,\u2019 many of whom rode the Giro this year, and it\u2019s exciting to help them develop and grow whilst also having the A team continuing to push their performance at the highest level.\u201d He has now added even more Latin talent to his roster by luring the recent Giro d\u2019Italia winner, Richard Carapaz, to Ineos. The signing is expected to be confirmed next week, when the Ecuadorian joins a team overflowing with stage racing talent. The absence of Froome may have diminished the Sky-Ineos aura of invincibility, but tactically Ineos were discreet and opportunistic, managing an indisputably weaker lineup than in past years and exploiting the ambitions of others to secure first and second overall. French riders lit up this Tour and without the bravura riding of Julian Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot, particularly in the Pyrenees when Thomas was not at his best, Bernal might not have leapfrogged his teammate to win the race. The Colombian\u2019s instinct to follow Pinot\u2019s accelerations on the Pyrenean summit finishes at the Col du Tourmalet and the climb to Foix Prat d\u2019Albis revealed the gulf in climbing ability between him and Thomas. After that it was merely a question of Bernal being given his head and claiming the lead in the Alps. That moment came on the climb of the Col de l\u2019Iseran, which Brailsford described as \u201c37 minutes to win the Tour\u201d. For all the talk of panache, flair and romance that characterised this Tour, Brailsford remained Spock-like in his analysis, stating he saw it as a \u201cchallenge of managing logic versus emotion\u201d. \u201cThis race, more than most, triggered that debate in my head. However, I believed that if we stayed disciplined, chose the right strategy and executed well then it was hard to see a different outcome than winning. In the end strategy, patience and belief won over chaos.\u201d That clinical assessment was proven correct but neglected to mention the honourable natures of his two leaders, who, unlike Wiggins and Froome, kept their cool in the Tour\u2019s hothouse. \u201cEgan\u2019s got morals,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cColombians are honest and family-oriented and I definitely feel that with Egan. The biggest thing is that he can speak English really well, so we can communicate.\u201d Yet the togetherness that secured the top two steps on the Paris podium on Sunday has been a remarkable turnaround for a team who were staring at extinction less than six months ago, with their big name riders potentially in the marketplace looking for new teams. \u201cWe know in life the goal posts will move \u2013 we just don\u2019t know when. So when they do it\u2019s best to quickly adjust to the new situation, accept it and don\u2019t spend any emotion feeling frustrated or bitter about it,\u201d Brailsford said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be prouder of how the team stuck together through this period and delivered both off the bike and on it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong>Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position:</strong> 6th (NB: this is not necessarily Nick Ames\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips)</p> \n<p><strong>Last season\u2019s position:</strong> 5th</p> \n<p><strong>Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): </strong>50-1</p> \n<p>It was still possible to believe Laurent Koscielny when, among the standard new-signing platitudes, he described Arsenal as \u201ca reference for football\u201d. It was July 2010 and they had just finished third in the Premier League, 11 points shy of champions Chelsea, but the afterglow of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s best days had not quite faded and the most fiscally painful moments of the heave into Emirates Stadium appeared to have passed. Two months later Ivan Gazidis, never shy to expound a grand vision during his time as chief executive, struck a similar note with regard to their off-field planning. \u201cThe game is increasingly looking towards Arsenal as a model of what a football club should be,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we have to keep moving forwards \u2013 standing still is never an option.\u201d</p> \n<p>Presumably \u201clurching backwards\u201d was not on his checklist either but Arsenal go into this season with their place among the division\u2019s elite looking no more secure than a year ago. A measure of how expectations have gradually slipped since those optimistic days at the decade\u2019s turn is offered by the fact that, while they can rightly aim to overhaul at least one of Tottenham and Chelsea en route to a first top-four finish in four years, there is as much to concern them in the forms of Leicester, Wolves and Everton narrowing the gap below.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/28/arsenal-lyon-alexandre-lacazette-injury\">Alexandre Lacazette suffers ankle injury in Arsenal friendly defeat by Lyon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Excuses have become a staple in their part of north London but, in one sense, those will run out this year. Unai Emery deserved a more or less free hit in 2018-19 and those spying an end to the retrograde trend will point out they finished one place and seven points better off than in Wenger\u2019s farewell campaign. There were some punchier home performances and a run to the Europa League final, much as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/29/chelsea-arsenal-europa-league-final-match-report-eden-hazard\">that ended ignominiously</a>. But for a club that had been so rooted in his predecessor\u2019s ideals it was hard, for much of the season, to define what Emery\u2019s style was; a fact not helped by his reluctance, either in Spanish or his stoic attempts at English, to offer inquisitors many morsels of explanation.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that Emery must return Arsenal to the Champions League and, should he not manage it, the break clause in his contract will look tempting for all parties next summer. Received wisdom has been that he must do it with a hand tied behind his back so it was to some surprise when, over the weekend, news emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/27/arsenal-transfer-record-72m-nicolas-pepe-lille\">Lille had accepted their club record \u00a372m offer</a> for Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. The Ivorian is an outstanding wide forward who scored 22 Ligue 1 goals last season; if Napoli\u2019s interest is dismissed then Arsenal will possess three prolific front men and again look like a club that can master the French market. It would be a bold, timely statement. There may not be much left in the budget after that although a move for Kieran Tierney, the impressive Celtic left-back, may eventually succeed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/arsenalposition-zip/giv-39027UQawGWUBwSI/\" data-alt=\"Past five seasons\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/arsenalposition-zip/giv-39027UQawGWUBwSI/\">Past five seasons</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Getting P\u00e9p\u00e9 over the line would boost morale but further changes are required. While bigger deals bubble away Emery has gone with the market he knows best \u2013 a trait that alienated Sven Mislintat, whose trumpeted but short-lived spell as head of recruitment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/21/arsenal-confirm-sven-mislintat-will-leave-club-on-8-february\">ended in February</a> \u2013 in loaning the 22-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/25/arsenal-sign-real-madrid-dani-ceballos-season-loan-unai-emery\">Dani Ceballos from Real Madrid</a>. It looks a smart move: Ceballos is a confident, spiky technician who will liven up a turgid midfield offering immeasurably if he settles quickly. The failure of last season\u2019s experiment with Denis Su\u00e1rez might then be consigned to memory, too.</p> \n<p>Two new 18-year-olds offer distinct promise and should, in time, help freshen up an ageing squad. Those who have watched Gabriel Martinelli, signed from the Brazilian club Ituano, suggest the forward is good enough to be spared the endless cycle of career-stalling loan moves commonly bestowed upon punts from South America. The arrival of William Saliba, an exceptionally promising defender from Saint-\u00c9tienne who will be loaned back to the Ligue 1 club, counts as a minor coup after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/18/william-saliba-decides-to-join-arsenal-instead-of-tottenham-hotspur\">rejected interest from Tottenham</a>. The slightest evidence of local supremacy is richly welcome these days. The striker Eddie Nketiah and midfielder Joe Willock, both academy products, impressed during a productive pre-season tour of the US and it would be no surprise if at least one of the pair were involved at Newcastle on the opening weekend.</p> \n<p>So the future could be in good hands, but Arsenal supporters have long been promised enough jam to decimate the country\u2019s fruit farms. They hope a reconnection with the past will restore some balance. Freddie Ljungberg has been promoted to assistant first-team coach while Edu\u2019s arrival as technical director is a canny move, and not only because the club would have benefited from such an appointment at any point in the last decade. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/archive-zip/giv-3902hb6JKZUCaPi1/\" data-alt=\"Last season's results\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/archive-zip/giv-3902hb6JKZUCaPi1/\">Last season's results</a> \n</figure> \n<p>An early item in Edu\u2019s intray will be to help Emery deal with Koscielny, who wants a return to France.

      "bodyText": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 6th (NB: this is not necessarily Nick Ames\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 5th Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 50-1 It was still possible to believe Laurent Koscielny when, among the standard new-signing platitudes, he described Arsenal as \u201ca reference for football\u201d. It was July 2010 and they had just finished third in the Premier League, 11 points shy of champions Chelsea, but the afterglow of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s best days had not quite faded and the most fiscally painful moments of the heave into Emirates Stadium appeared to have passed. Two months later Ivan Gazidis, never shy to expound a grand vision during his time as chief executive, struck a similar note with regard to their off-field planning. \u201cThe game is increasingly looking towards Arsenal as a model of what a football club should be,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we have to keep moving forwards \u2013 standing still is never an option.\u201d Presumably \u201clurching backwards\u201d was not on his checklist either but Arsenal go into this season with their place among the division\u2019s elite looking no more secure than a year ago. A measure of how expectations have gradually slipped since those optimistic days at the decade\u2019s turn is offered by the fact that, while they can rightly aim to overhaul at least one of Tottenham and Chelsea en route to a first top-four finish in four years, there is as much to concern them in the forms of Leicester, Wolves and Everton narrowing the gap below. Excuses have become a staple in their part of north London but, in one sense, those will run out this year. Unai Emery deserved a more or less free hit in 2018-19 and those spying an end to the retrograde trend will point out they finished one place and seven points better off than in Wenger\u2019s farewell campaign. There were some punchier home performances and a run to the Europa League final, much as that ended ignominiously. But for a club that had been so rooted in his predecessor\u2019s ideals it was hard, for much of the season, to define what Emery\u2019s style was; a fact not helped by his reluctance, either in Spanish or his stoic attempts at English, to offer inquisitors many morsels of explanation. The bottom line is that Emery must return Arsenal to the Champions League and, should he not manage it, the break clause in his contract will look tempting for all parties next summer. Received wisdom has been that he must do it with a hand tied behind his back so it was to some surprise when, over the weekend, news emerged that Lille had accepted their club record \u00a372m offer for Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. The Ivorian is an outstanding wide forward who scored 22 Ligue 1 goals last season; if Napoli\u2019s interest is dismissed then Arsenal will possess three prolific front men and again look like a club that can master the French market. It would be a bold, timely statement. There may not be much left in the budget after that although a move for Kieran Tierney, the impressive Celtic left-back, may eventually succeed. Getting P\u00e9p\u00e9 over the line would boost morale but further changes are required. While bigger deals bubble away Emery has gone with the market he knows best \u2013 a trait that alienated Sven Mislintat, whose trumpeted but short-lived spell as head of recruitment ended in February \u2013 in loaning the 22-year-old Dani Ceballos from Real Madrid. It looks a smart move: Ceballos is a confident, spiky technician who will liven up a turgid midfield offering immeasurably if he settles quickly. The failure of last season\u2019s experiment with Denis Su\u00e1rez might then be consigned to memory, too. Two new 18-year-olds offer distinct promise and should, in time, help freshen up an ageing squad. Those who have watched Gabriel Martinelli, signed from the Brazilian club Ituano, suggest the forward is good enough to be spared the endless cycle of career-stalling loan moves commonly bestowed upon punts from South America. The arrival of William Saliba, an exceptionally promising defender from Saint-\u00c9tienne who will be loaned back to the Ligue 1 club, counts as a minor coup after he rejected interest from Tottenham. The slightest evidence of local supremacy is richly welcome these days. The striker Eddie Nketiah and midfielder Joe Willock, both academy products, impressed during a productive pre-season tour of the US and it would be no surprise if at least one of the pair were involved at Newcastle on the opening weekend. So the future could be in good hands, but Arsenal supporters have long been promised enough jam to decimate the country\u2019s fruit farms. They hope a reconnection with the past will restore some balance. Freddie Ljungberg has been promoted to assistant first-team coach while Edu\u2019s arrival as technical director is a canny move, and not only because the club would have benefited from such an appointment at any point in the last decade. An early item in Edu\u2019s intray will be to help Emery deal with Koscielny, who wants a return to France. The captain is one of few at Arsenal to come out of the past nine years virtually unblemished so it was a surprise, and perhaps a reflection on the club\u2019s management in recent years, that he felt moved to skip the trip across the Atlantic. Something has gone badly wrong somewhere and it presents an immediate headache for Emery, whose other centre-back options provoke grimaces and flashbacks to 21 April, when a disastrous performance from Shkodran Mustafi against Palace effectively relinquished Arsenal\u2019s hold on a Champions League spot. He has two top-class strikers in Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose rapport brought 40 goals last season and bailed out a number of shapeless displays, and will have another go at energising Mesut \u00d6zil, who has shown enough recently to suggest his cause might not be lost. Arsenal can still blow moderate opponents away with that firepower but new defenders are required to give Emery a fighting chance.

Trump had long been skeptical of the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies, which provoked his ire by concluding that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election with the goal of getting him elected.

Coats had been among the last of the seasoned foreign policy hands brought to surround the president after his 2016 victory, of whom the president steadily grew tired as he gained more personal confidence in the Oval Office, officials said. That roster included the defense secretary Jim Mattis and the secretary of state Rex Tillerson, and later national security adviser HR McMaster. Coats developed a reputation inside the administration for sober presentations to the president of intelligence conclusions that occasionally contradicted Trump\u2019s policy aims. His departure had been rumoured for months, and intelligence officials had been expecting him to leave before the 2020 presidential campaign season reached its peak. Trump\u2019s announcement that Coats would be leaving came days after former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s public testimony on his two-year investigation into Russian election interference and potential obstruction of justice by Trump, which officials said both emboldened and infuriated the president. Coats had been among the least visible of the president\u2019s senior administration officials but, in his limited public appearances, repeatedly seemed at odds with the administration, including about Russia. For instance, he revealed to Mueller\u2019s investigators how Trump, angry over investigations into links between his campaign and Russia, tried unsuccessfully in March 2017 to get him to make a public statement refuting any connection. \u201cCoats responded that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has nothing to do with investigations and it was not his role to make a public statement on the Russia investigation,\u201d Mueller\u2019s report said.

That challenge has been made virtually impossible by the other two things Smith has sacrificed some life expectancy for: Brexit, and keeping the 10 Democratic Unionist party (DUP) MPs onside in order to deliver Brexit. There has been a longstanding tendency in Westminster to generally ignore Northern Ireland. Ignoring it until it becomes a problem inside the region is not new, but Northern Ireland is now the central challenge of Brexit, and the failure of Britain\u2019s entire political and media class to properly understand it has evolved from tendency to pathology. So it is that over the past few days, everyone from the new prime minister to senior political journalists has blithely asserted that the government should focus on getting the Stormont institutions up and running. As most of Irish history bears out, people in Westminster confidently asserting that things \u201cshould\u201d happen on the island of Ireland have not necessarily led to those things happening. At this moment, Brexit and the associated confidence and supply deal with the DUP that keeps the Tories \u2013 just about \u2013 in power have changed the structural overlay of Northern Irish politics so dramatically as to make getting the institutions back up and running a virtual impossibility.

      "body": "<p>The last day of the parliamentary session before the summer recess normally marks the period when the Treasury starts to wind down for the summer. The chancellor takes a break and a skeleton team takes control. But not this year.</p> <p>Seated next to Boris Johnson as he made his first statement to MPs last Thursday was Sajid Javid, the new chancellor of the exchequer, and the man given the task of delivering the prime minister\u2019s tax and spending pledges this autumn.</p> <p>This is a big responsibility for Javid, who has spent his first days in the Treasury running through options with officials. The chancellor is aware of what the prime minister expects of him \u2013 a break with the austerity of the past decade \u2013 and there is money available, even if that means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/30/johnson-prepared-increase-public-borrowing\">higher public borrowing</a>. The only question now is how and when to spend it.</p> <p>Theresa May had used the promise of higher spending after Brexit as a carrot to win backing for her deal, but failed. According to observers, Johnson appears to be doing two things: revving up the economy to gain support for his plans with a fallback that more spending could cushion the fallout of a no-deal departure.</p> <p>Matthew Whittaker, the deputy chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cMay came in saying her job was to deliver Brexit, which was hard to be judged against. It\u2019s a difficult thing, and a pretty gloomy one.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to Johnson\u2019s upbeat statements about Brexit since entering Downing Street, he added: \u201cBut to say we\u2019re entering a \u2018golden age\u2019 and let\u2019s be more confident, let\u2019s leave \u2013 and with more teachers in schools and police on the streets \u2013 then it becomes easier to say \u2018trust me on Brexit\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01eaa82c0fc26b713feb5e562cca73c73d5c2b89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01eaa82c0fc26b713feb5e562cca73c73d5c2b89/121_95_5152_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid and Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid knows what the prime minister expects: a break with the austerity of the past decade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many things about Johnson, the plan mirrors Donald Trump, who cut taxes to boost US growth through a tough trade war with the rest of the world, Whittaker added.</p> <p>Even before entering No 10, Johnson had made a series of promises while campaigning to be prime minister, some more specific than others. He pledged \u00a31bn to hire 20,000 new police officers and getting on for \u00a35bn to reverse the cuts to schools\u2019 spending since 2015. </p> <p>On the tax side, he said he wanted to raise the 40% income tax threshold from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000 and to raise the level at which workers start paying national insurance contributions (NICs). But, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has noted, these are expensive commitments. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/the-cost-of-boris-johnson-pricing-up-the-next-prime-minister-pledges\">income tax promise would cost \u00a39bn a year</a>; NICs changes could come with an \u00a311bn price tag. Javid could go for broke and deliver these massive cuts in one go. More likely he will spread them over several years and make a start in the coming months.</p> <p>Further pledges have been made in Johnson\u2019s first few days in power, including funding a new trans-Pennine rail route between Leeds and Manchester and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/27/critics-doubt-boris-johnson-can-deliver-new-rail-route-pledge\">a \u00a33.6bn fund for \u201cleft behind towns\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db2632541f51491c26eca76069745a2c14bac573\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db2632541f51491c26eca76069745a2c14bac573/0_237_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson in front of an engine Manchester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson appears to be trying to to rev up Britain\u2019s economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Javid will do is exploit the space for extra borrowing created by the fiscal rules inherited from Philip Hammond. The previous chancellor said government borrowing should be below 2% of Gross Domestic Product \u2013 a measure of the economy\u2019s output - by 2020-21. However, the current level of borrowing is lower than that, at roughly 1.1%. The new government can therefore borrow a bit more \u2013 about \u00a326bn \u2013 and still meet the rule.</p> <p>Although framed by Johnson as spending headroom at his disposal, economists say the additional firepower is something of an illusion. Thomas Pugh, of the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t money sitting in a savings account waiting to be spent. It\u2019s more like borrowing from an overdraft where the limit is set at 2% of annual income. So spending it would result in a higher deficit and more borrowing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-28T15:28:32/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Hammond\u2019s target for borrowing to fall below 2% of GDP has been hit\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-28T15:28:32/embed.html\">Hammond\u2019s target for borrowing to fall below 2% of GDP has been hit</a> </figure>  <p>The \u00a326bn calculation is based on the strength of the economy in March, when the calculation was last made by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog.

      "bodyText": "The last day of the parliamentary session before the summer recess normally marks the period when the Treasury starts to wind down for the summer. The chancellor takes a break and a skeleton team takes control. But not this year. Seated next to Boris Johnson as he made his first statement to MPs last Thursday was Sajid Javid, the new chancellor of the exchequer, and the man given the task of delivering the prime minister\u2019s tax and spending pledges this autumn. This is a big responsibility for Javid, who has spent his first days in the Treasury running through options with officials. The chancellor is aware of what the prime minister expects of him \u2013 a break with the austerity of the past decade \u2013 and there is money available, even if that means higher public borrowing. The only question now is how and when to spend it. Theresa May had used the promise of higher spending after Brexit as a carrot to win backing for her deal, but failed. According to observers, Johnson appears to be doing two things: revving up the economy to gain support for his plans with a fallback that more spending could cushion the fallout of a no-deal departure. Matthew Whittaker, the deputy chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cMay came in saying her job was to deliver Brexit, which was hard to be judged against. It\u2019s a difficult thing, and a pretty gloomy one.\u201d Referring to Johnson\u2019s upbeat statements about Brexit since entering Downing Street, he added: \u201cBut to say we\u2019re entering a \u2018golden age\u2019 and let\u2019s be more confident, let\u2019s leave \u2013 and with more teachers in schools and police on the streets \u2013 then it becomes easier to say \u2018trust me on Brexit\u2019.\u201d Like many things about Johnson, the plan mirrors Donald Trump, who cut taxes to boost US growth through a tough trade war with the rest of the world, Whittaker added. Even before entering No 10, Johnson had made a series of promises while campaigning to be prime minister, some more specific than others. He pledged \u00a31bn to hire 20,000 new police officers and getting on for \u00a35bn to reverse the cuts to schools\u2019 spending since 2015. On the tax side, he said he wanted to raise the 40% income tax threshold from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000 and to raise the level at which workers start paying national insurance contributions (NICs). But, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has noted, these are expensive commitments. The income tax promise would cost \u00a39bn a year; NICs changes could come with an \u00a311bn price tag. Javid could go for broke and deliver these massive cuts in one go. More likely he will spread them over several years and make a start in the coming months. Further pledges have been made in Johnson\u2019s first few days in power, including funding a new trans-Pennine rail route between Leeds and Manchester and a \u00a33.6bn fund for \u201cleft behind towns\u201d. What Javid will do is exploit the space for extra borrowing created by the fiscal rules inherited from Philip Hammond. The previous chancellor said government borrowing should be below 2% of Gross Domestic Product \u2013 a measure of the economy\u2019s output - by 2020-21. However, the current level of borrowing is lower than that, at roughly 1.1%. The new government can therefore borrow a bit more \u2013 about \u00a326bn \u2013 and still meet the rule. Although framed by Johnson as spending headroom at his disposal, economists say the additional firepower is something of an illusion. Thomas Pugh, of the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t money sitting in a savings account waiting to be spent. It\u2019s more like borrowing from an overdraft where the limit is set at 2% of annual income. So spending it would result in a higher deficit and more borrowing.\u201d The \u00a326bn calculation is based on the strength of the economy in March, when the calculation was last made by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog. Growth has since slowed to stalling point, with a one in four chance Britain has already fallen into recession. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) warned no-deal Brexit could cause a \u201csevere downturn\u201d and cause public borrowing to rise. Jagjit Chadha, the director of the NIESR, said: \u201cPinning down expenditure on the basis of a forecast you know will get revised doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d The OBR has said the new prime minister\u2019s giveaway package \u201cwould push government borrowing and debt up from the levels expected in our forecasts and that there is no war chest or pot of money set aside that would make them a free lunch\u201d. Leaving the EU without a deal would add \u00a330bn a year to borrowing from 2020-21 onwards as the economy plunges into recession, it added. Since the 1990s, successive governments have set fiscal rules. Gordon Brown had a \u201cgolden rule\u201d only to borrow for investment, while George Osborne pledged to eliminate the deficit within five years from 2010, before he failed and moved the goalposts. The budget deficit \u2013 the annual shortfall between government spending and income from tax receipts \u2013 has steadily improved since spiking after the financial crisis. It came down from \u00a3153bn, or 9.9% of GDP, in 2009-10, to \u00a323.5bn, or 1.1% of GDP, in 2018-19. However, the national debt pile \u2013 which increases with every year of deficit \u2013 has risen to more than \u00a31.8tn, or 83.1% of GDP. Economists debate how dangerous this might be, warning it could leave the UK vulnerable to shocks. It remains below some international comparisons, such as Japan, where debt is more than 250% of GDP, and Italy, where it is more than 130%. Rishi Sunak, Johnson\u2019s new chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News on Thursday he wanted to keep a Tory rule that Britain\u2019s total debt pile should fall as a percentage of GDP each year. The OBR estimated that government borrowing could rise by about \u00a325bn per year by 2024 under such a constraint. However, that still assumes economic growth, which crashing out of the EU could imperil. Johnson turning on the spending taps could have serious consequences for Labour, which was getting used to comfortably outgunning government spending proposals under Jeremy Corbyn, generally to a warm reception. The fabric of the welfare state has grown frayed from a decade of austerity. Britain suffers from austerity fatigue and is ready for higher spending. Labour, though, is stuck fighting a previous war. Despite economists generally agreeing that austerity was a massive policy mistake, the party has yet to convince voters that it can be trusted with sound financial management. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, promised to match Johnson\u2019s spending increase but doubted the new prime minister would end austerity entirely. \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re priorities we\u2019ve been arguing for to a certain extent.

The chief executive, Brett Himbury, said IFM, which invests on behalf of Australian industry super funds and like-minded international pension outfits, also supports mining giant BHP\u2019s new pledge to do more to curb carbon emissions. Himbury was speaking as IFM, which is owned by union and employer group-controlled industry super funds, announced annual results which saw the retirement savings it manages surge by 31%, or $22m, after investors fled high-cost commercial operators following last year\u2019s banking royal commission. Over the past few years corporate Australia has cut deep in an effort to maintain its profit margins. Telstra\u2019s announcement last month that it would sack 10,000 contractors over the next two years followed hot on the heels of reports that the Commonwealth Bank was planning to lay off a similar number of employees. The reports were partly denied by the CBA chief executive, Matt Comyn, but all four big banks have been cutting costs for years, and all but Westpac are now trying to shrink further by shedding the scandal-ridden wealth management and insurance businesses that sparked the Hayne royal commission. Himbury said the balance between cost-cutting to create an immediate bump in profits and investing for long-term revenue growth would be one of the key themes IFM would be looking at as listed companies declare their full-year earnings over the next month. \u201cMy sense is that there\u2019s been a lot of focus on cost reduction, but in terms of optimising long-term enterprise value you\u2019d want to make sure there are sustainable sources of profitable revenue growth that enterprises are looking at,\u201d he said. He said cost reduction can \u201conly go so far\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re now the third largest equity manager, we\u2019re investing on behalf of industry funds. \u201cAs long-term investors, we\u2019d probably be more focused on long-term revenue growth and less \u2013 still, but less \u2013 focused on cost, because we\u2019re likely to be on the share register for a longer period of time. \u201cIn that regard we\u2019ll be encouraging and supporting \u2013 respecting the role of boards and management \u2013 but at the same time encouraging them to think long-term to improve the profitable revenue of their business.\u201d Himbury said IFM supported an ambitious plan announced last week by the BHP CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, to reduce carbon pollution that includes tying executive remuneration to emissions generated by its customers and setting up a US$400m fund to reduce its own impact on the climate. \u201cThey, like us, believe that climate change is real, that carbon emissions are impacting climate change, and they like us believe we need to do more to get emissions down so that we can moderate the growth in warming and the potential significant consequences of that,\u201d he said. He said IFM preferred to \u201cinvest and actively manage\u201d the carbon emissions of companies, rather than excluding enterprises from investment or dumping its shares in them. \u201cAs long-term investors we have the capacity not just to provide capital but to influence the enterprises that that capital is going into,\u201d he said. \u201cIf over time our influence is not being responded to, we may well divest.\u201d He said it was \u201ca bit harsh\u201d to describe Australian business as a backwater in dealing with the climate crisis.

If you do then you\u2019re going to act it badly, because you\u2019re going to be constantly flagging to the audience, \u2018It\u2019s not me, it\u2019s the character.\u2019\u201d Making the show gave Keddie much to think about concerning her family with artist Vincent Fantauzzo. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenging time for people of our generation that are raising children,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause so much hardwired behaviour that we grew up with is not acceptable anymore. I\u2019m raising two boys, and this project\u2019s really made me think about how they see myself and my partner and our relationship. How do we guide them through this extremely new world that they\u2019re jumping into?\u201d Teenage girls of generations past have experimented with their newfound sexual power as much as those of Gen Z, but it\u2019s harder for Gen X parents to understand the high-risk appeal of sending photos that could be shared without consent within seconds. Short of having your own darkroom in the 80s or 90s, it wasn\u2019t really an option. Rebecca Summerton, one of the show\u2019s producers, says, \u201cWhat\u2019s being taught in a lot of schools is abstinence \u2013 don\u2019t take a photo of yourself nude. But my daughter\u2019s whole language in talking to her friends is visual; in fact, the more photos you send in Snapchat, the higher your score.\u201d One of the characters in The Hunting, Zoe (Luca Asta Sardelis), was photographed without her knowledge, via a screenshot during a Skype hookup. Having such an image taken or created without consent is something that one in five surveyed Australians has experienced. Another, Dip (Kavitha Anandasivam), had provided a picture to her boyfriend in what might have been a thoroughly modern effort to delay having actual sex. Summerton says that advising people not to send nudes is as pointless as it was for 60s parents to advise children growing up in the \u201cfree love\u201d era not to have sex. \u201cThe more progressive thoughts around it are we need to talk about consent and we need to talk about respect and those kind of ideas,\u201d she says, \u201cand that\u2019s the area we\u2019re exploring here.\u201d \u2022 The Hunting is showing on SBS from Thursday 1 August, 8.30pm \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August to correctly identify the actors playing the characters of Zoe and Dip",

His idea, a brilliantly simple visual aid to understanding logical relations, is one of the few concepts from abstract mathematics that is easily understood, and regularly used, by non-mathematicians. Indeed, only last week it was revealed that Boris Johnson had planned his Cabinet by drawing a Venn diagram: in one circle he put Brexiteers, and, in the other, people capable of running the country.

The diagram needs to include four sets and all possible regions shared between the sets, i.e. there is a region in any one set, and outside all others; there is a region in any two sets and outside the others; there is a region in any three sets and outside the other; there is a region inside all sets. I\u2019ll be back with the answers at 5pm UK. PLEASE NO SPOILERS UPDATE: Solutions now up. If you want to tweet or email me Venn diagrams with the answers to any of today\u2019s questions, please do. I\u2019ll include the best ones when I post the answers later today. In fact, if you can devise any funny Venn diagrams \u2013 in the manner of Stephen Wildish (or Boris Johnson) \u2013 send them in too. NOTE: The questions have been rephrased since the post first launched for clarity. Thanks to Craig Barton. His website Maths Venns contains many problems like the ones above. You can also find a huge amount of free material for teachers and students at Mr Barton Maths. He also has a podcast, and has written a critically-acclaimed book How I Wish I\u2019d Taught Maths. Thanks to Stephen Wildish of Wildish and Co. Many of his best images are included in his book Chartography. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. I\u2019m the author of Football School, a book series for 7 to 12 year olds that opens up the curriculum through football. Football School Star Players: 50 Inspiring Stories of True Football Heroes is just out. It profiles 50 footballers \u2013 including Women\u2019s World Cup heroes Lucy Bronze and Megan Rapinoe \u2013 who show that football can be a force for good both on and off the pitch.",

These provisions require people to notify the relevant LPA (using what\u2019s referred to as a section 211 notice) six weeks before any intended work on the protected trees to obtain the LPA\u2019s consent for the work. However, you don\u2019t have to get permission for a tree which has a trunk which is less than 75mm measured at 1.5m above ground level but I doubt this exception applies to your trees. You might want to let your neighbours know that if they plan to lop off the overhanging branches, they also need to get consent from the LPA before doing so.

If you do decide to serve a section 211 notice, it\u2019s worth getting a professional tree surgeon to do it for you. LPAs expect you to be clear about exactly what work is being proposed.

      "bodyText": "At sunrise, the misty fields around the village of Guior are already dotted with men, women and children sowing maize after an overnight rainstorm. After several years of drought, the downpour brought some hope of relief to the subsistence farmers in this part of eastern Guatemala. But as Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez, 30, takes a break from his work, he explains why he is still willing to incur crippling debts \u2013 and risk his life \u2013 to migrate to the United States. \u201cMy children have gone to bed hungry for the past three years. Our crops failed and the coffee farms have cut wages to $4 a day,\u201d he says, playing nervously with the white maize kernels in a plastic trough strapped to his waist. \u201cWe hope the harvest will be good, but until then we have only one quintal [46kg] of maize left \u2013 which is barely enough for a month. I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more.\u201d Central America remains one of the world\u2019s most dangerous regions outside a warzone, where a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption has forced millions to flee their homes and head north in search of security. But amid a deepening global climate crisis, drought, famine and the battle for dwindling natural resources are increasingly being recognized as major factors in the exodus. Camot\u00e1n is a collection of rural communities in the eastern department of Chiquimula, which lies in the rain shadow of the imposing Sierra de las Minas. It forms part of Central America\u2019s dry corridor: a belt stretching south through Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, that receives little rain and is particularly susceptible to droughts and extreme weather. In theory, the rainy season here should last from late April to October, with a drier period in July and August known as the can\u00edcula \u2013 a regional peculiarity that requires two short harvests. But the past decade has seen frequent, intense droughts and late rains due to unusually hot and dry can\u00edculas and prolonged years of El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 the warm phase of a complex weather cycle caused by increased Pacific surface temperatures. \u201cOver the past six years, the lack of rainfall has been our biggest problem, causing crops to fail and widespread famine,\u201d said the climate scientist Edwin Castellanos, the dean of the research institute at Guatemala\u2019s Universidad del Valle. The current run of hot, dry years follows a decade or so of unusually prolonged rains and flooding due to the other phase of the cycle known as La Ni\u00f1a, caused by colder Pacific waters. \u201cNormal, predictable weather years are getting rarer,\u201d added Castellanos. On the ground, the impact has been devastating. In 2018, drought-related crop failures directly affected one in 10 Guatemalans, and caused extreme food shortages for almost 840,000 people, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). As a result, entire families have been migrating in record numbers: since October 2018, more than 167,000 Guatemalans travelling in family groups have been apprehended at the US border, compared with 23,000 in 2016. Those who remain, often depend on money sent home by emigres, especially in rural areas, which received more than half the $9.2bn of remittances sent to Guatemala in 2018. Despite the rainshowers in Camot\u00e1n, el ni\u00f1o is back and the outlook for 2019 is grim: about 2 million people in the dry corridor will need urgent food aid, according Ricardo Rapallo, the head of food security at the FAO. \u201cWithout doubt climate and environmental changes impact food security. For those who depend on agriculture the situation is very precarious, they are very vulnerable,\u201d said Rapallo. Local political factors are also important. Water shortages and poverty are causally linked to the country\u2019s skewed land distribution: roughly 2% of the population control 70% of all productive farmland. In Chiquimula, 71% of people live in poverty, and 40% in extreme poverty. Forests mitigate climate change, but Guatemala has lost half its woodlands in the past 40 years \u2013 and deforestation rates are rising, in turn causing floods, landslides and erosion of farmland. In the peasant farming communities around Camot\u00e1n, water storage is scarce, and the Maya Ch\u2019orti\u2019 people who live here mostly rely on rainfall to irrigate their crops. Most houses have no toilets, and low water reserves mean most families drink and cook with contaminated stream water. \u201cWe waste and contaminate most of our water through mismanagement. We\u2019re not prepared for climate changes,\u201d said the climate scientist Castellanos. The region\u2019s main cash crop is coffee, and for decades, many campesinos relied on seasonal work at commercial plantations to supplement their subsistence lifestyle. But a global price crash and the deadly rust fungus known locally as la rolla \u2013 which thrives in hot and humid conditions exacerbated by the climate crisis \u2013 have wiped out about 80% of the region\u2019s coffee in the past five years. This has led to less work, lower pay and more hunger. Guti\u00e9rrez lives in a half-finished palm-roofed adobe house with his wife Miriam \u00c1valos, 22, and their five children aged between seven months and nine years. All of the children are small for their age. For breakfast, they have half a corn tortilla each. At school, they sometimes receive noodles and a high-calorie supplement drink, courtesy of a government programme. Dinner is another tortilla or two with salt or herbs \u2013 but no beans as the drought destroyed last year\u2019s entire crop. The family\u2019s chickens died a few months back from a mystery illness, so there are no eggs, and meat and dairy are unaffordable. The adults eat once or twice a day. Guatemala has the sixth-highest malnutrition rate in the world with at least 47% of children suffering chronic malnourishment. Malnutrition rates are even higher among the country\u2019s 24 indigenous communities, rising to over 60% in Camot\u00e1n. Since 2016, at least 800 children under the age of five in Camot\u00e1n and the neighbouring municipality Jocot\u00e1n have been diagnosed with acute malnourishment, according to health centre officials. (Underreporting means the real number is likely to be significantly higher.) \u201cThe government strategy [to tackle malnutrition] has good elements, but in practice it has been limited to putting out fires, dealing with emergencies, not tackling structural problems or corruption in public administration,\u201d said Paola Cano, a nutritionist and public policy analyst. \u201cWithout international aid, even more people would be dying.\u201d \u00c1valos was 13 when she had her first child. She weighs 90lb and is breastfeeding her seven-month old daughter who weighs just nine pounds. The two-year-old girl weighs 18lbs; her cheeks and stomach are distended, and her hair is falling out \u2013 classic symptoms of acute malnutrition. The five-year-old girl is just recovering from sudden weight loss. Sometimes they wake up at night, crying from hunger. \u201cWe\u2019re desperate,\u201d said \u00c1valos, who looks and sounds exhausted. \u201cThere\u2019s no money and no food.\u201d \u00c1valos\u2019s niece died in 2016 at the age of three months. Her mother was unable to produce enough breast milk, and the family couldn\u2019t afford formula. \u201cThis isn\u2019t poverty \u2013 or even extreme poverty: this is a famine, and people are dying,\u201d said Rodimiro Lant\u00e1n from Comundich, a grassroots Ch\u2019orti\u2019 organisation helping communities reforest ancestral lands in an effort to prevent forced migration. Families face an impossible choice: stay and risk starvation, or gamble everything on the perilous migrant trail. \u201cThey risk their lives if they stay \u2013 and if they go,\u201d said Lant\u00e1n. One local who took that chance was Juan de L\u00e9on Guti\u00e9rrez, a 16-year old boy from a nearby village. In April, he died at a Texas children\u2019s hospital just days after he was taken into US immigration custody \u2013 one of at least eight Guatemalan children to have died shortly after crossing the US border since May 2018. Juan de L\u00e9on was not related to Esteban, but such deaths are deeply felt in these rural communities where would be migrants are well aware of the dangers they will face. Esteban is in tears as he leaves the family home to meet a local people smuggler, or coyote, who may be able to guide him north. He has no savings, but, his godfather has offered the coyote the title to 3.5 acres of land as a guarantee. If Esteban makes it to the US, he\u2019ll pay the $5,000 fee; if he doesn\u2019t, the coyote will keep the land. \u201cBanks don\u2019t help people like us,\u201d he says, through tears. He has been told that families have a better chance at the border, so he is considering taking his scrawny nine-year-old son, Wilson, with him. He knows that taking a chronically malnourished child on a 2,000-mile journey will be tough \u2013 but he cannot afford to wait: the food is running out. In these parts, the period between harvests, June to August, has always been hard. But the current crisis is different, said Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s mother Isigra Mart\u00ednez, 58, as she heated leftover tortillas for lunch. \u201cWe grew up hungry, but the past four years have been very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want my son to go to America, and it will be terribly hard on Wilson.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard people have died on the journey. But maybe there\u2019s no other way.\u201d",

The News Corp paper claimed that the Threatened Species Recovery Hub was an \u201canti-coal group\u201d made up of \u201cgreenies\u201d who had been \u201chand-picked by the Palaszczuk government to review one of the mine\u2019s environmental management plans\u201d. But the Australian Press Council said the hub is a collaboration of research scientists engaged in issues of threatened species and only one member was involved in the review. \u201cThe council considers the publication failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the \u2018anti-coal group\u2019 headline was accurate, not misleading, and fair and balanced,\u201d the council said in an adjudication published by the Courier on Monday. The newspaper reported, in print and online, in January that \u201cthe fate of Queensland\u2019s Carmichael mine is in the hands of an environmental group whose members champion radical action on climate change, oppose coal and have appeared as expert witnesses against Adani\u201d. The Hub complained to the press council that the article implied they were environmental activists, when in fact they were a \u201ccollaboration of more than 150 world-class research scientists from the CSIRO, Australian Universities and various non-government organisations working on the challenge of how to recover Australia\u2019s threatened species.\u201d Some of the errors were caused by incorrect information provided by the Queensland government to the Courier-Mail, but the paper did not contact the Hub prior to publication and only got the views of Adani. The newspaper published an opinion piece by the deputy director of the Hub on 22 February 2019 which was a robust defence of scientific practice. It also said the Hub did not request that it be able to respond in the opinion piece more generally to the article. The Press Council requires publications to take reasonable steps to ensure factual material is accurate and not misleading (general principle 1) and presented with reasonable fairness and balance (general principle 3). In this case, the Courier breached principles 1 and 3. \u201cThe council notes that the terms \u2018compromised\u2019 and \u2018incapable of carrying out a review\u2019 are not presented as fact or comment by the publication but as direct quotations from the Adani spokesperson,\u201d the adjudication says. \u201cHowever, the publication did not contact the Hub for comment prior to publication and the Council considers that it was not reasonably fair and balanced to only present Adani\u2019s perspective.

If you don\u2019t have time for a wine-tasting trip, another top producer, <strong><a href=\"http://bendida.eu/en/\">Bendida</a></strong>, has a bar and shop in the pedestrianised Kapana district.

The hottest place in town is <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pavaj.plovdiv/\" title=\"\">Pavaj</a></strong> (mains from \u00a36). Its young owners, Raycho Markov and Madlen Pakratyan, are obsessive about their trade, from growing rare heritage tomatoes in Markov\u2019s father\u2019s garden in the mountains to travelling the Balkans in search of great rakia (fruit brandy). Ask nicely and they may offer you samples from the restaurant\u2019s impressive collection. The food is simple and seasonal, from salads and meatballs to grilled sheep\u2019s cheese and bread made to Raycho\u2019s grandmother\u2019s recipe. The pillow-soft rolls are cut in half, fried in clarified butter and sprinkled with a salt and spice mix. It may just be the most addictive thing you try in Bulgaria. Be sure to book ahead. Another good option is the recently opened <strong>Aylyakriya</strong>, (Kozhukarska 3), also in Kapana, that does smart takes on traditional dishes, such as <em>ka\u010damak</em> (polenta), pork ribs and beans and an exceptional strawberry cheesecake (mains from around \u00a36).</p> <h2><strong>Restaurant with a view</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3506816c07a4de787e6048cfe34401eef4f7f7e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3506816c07a4de787e6048cfe34401eef4f7f7e7/0_66_4997_2998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hemingway restaurant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The restaurant Hemingway on Gurko Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the edge of the old town and overlooking the Kapana district, the shady terrace of <strong><a href=\"https://www.philippopolis.com/en/Restaurant/m/37\">Restaurant Philoppopolis</a></strong> (mains from about \u00a312) has one of the best views in the city (Philoppopolis was the ancient name for Plovdiv). The interior is in 1920s Viennese style and there is a gallery and museum in the same building. It\u2019s the most romantic place to eat in Plovdiv.

She worked as a shoe designer for 23 years before opening her own shop three years ago. For me this sums up the story of Kapana: it provides spaces for people to pursue their craft and sell what they make directly to customers.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s for breakfast? Banitsa is a Bulgarian breakfast staple. The flaky pastry parcels are filled with sirene cheese (similar to Greek feta). One of the best places to try one is at Bakeland, on the edge of the Kapana and Old Town districts. It also makes delicious handmade cakes and sweets, with a few gluten-free options. Night at the opera The Ancient Theatre is Plovdiv\u2019s most famous cultural landmark: a Roman amphitheatre in a dramatic position on a hill above the city. Visitors can enjoy performances by the Plovdiv Opera and its international guests while sitting on ancient marble seats looking over the whole city centre, with the Rhodope mountains in the distance \u2013 a breathtaking spectacle. \u2022 bulgariatravel.org Creative district Kapana is now the creative heart of the city, a pedestrianised area full of shops, restaurants and galleries. In the 1990s it was a parking zone full of ruined houses. The transformation began in 2014, when 10 creative enterprises moved into the area, funded by the European Capital of Culture Foundation, and things have taken off from there. The best place to enjoy the city\u2019s art scene is a space called Cu29. It combines a cafe and gallery and was established by artist Velizar Dimchev to promote emerging talent from Plovdiv. Afterwards grab a drink at Kapana\u2019s coolest cocktail bar, Ginger Tale. Art and bath Very often cultural experiences in Plovdiv are an interesting mix of contemporary art and centuries-old architectural and cultural monuments. Established in 1995, the Ancient Bath was run by an independent art association for more than 20 years. The interior of the 16th-century Turkish bath is still intact, so art pieces are set in an authentic atmosphere with original stone walls and a stunning central dome. Currently the space is managed by the City Gallery and is the main venue for contemporary art exhibitions. It\u2019s especially pleasant during the summer months and early September, when it remains cool in the Plovdiv heat. \u2022 plovdiv2019.eu Ottoman-era houses Hilly Plovdiv old town is famed for its photogenic winding cobbled streets and beautifully preserved Ottoman-era townhouses. One of the most splendid is the Hindliyan House, whose Armenian merchant owner installed a rose-water fountain in the hayet, or main living space. This has recently been restored to its former, fragrant glory \u2013 the smell fills the room. Another favourite is Klianti House, which has beautifully painted ceilings and half-size rooms with tiny doors that were once used for storing the merchant\u2019s wares. It feels like you have entered floor 7\u00bd in Being John Malkovich. \u2022 Entry to each house 5 Lev (\u00a32.29). A \u00a37 ticket gives entry to five Old Town locations Drink Thracian wine The dusty plain on which Plovdiv is built has a perfect climate for growing grapes, particularly red varieties, such as the rich, dark mavrud (apparently, it has been grown here since Thracian times). Bulgaria Wine Tours organises wine-tasting trips from a half-day to a week (from \u20ac80 for a half-day, reductions for groups of over three). Local vineyards of note include Dragomir, Villa Yustine and the organic Zagreus. If you don\u2019t have time for a wine-tasting trip, another top producer, Bendida, has a bar and shop in the pedestrianised Kapana district. It\u2019s run by the third generation of the Portev family, who have a vineyard a few miles outside the city in the foothills of the Rhodope mountains. The family tradition is in safe hands: daughter Elizabet is already producing award-winning ros\u00e9s. Hot takes on old dishes Food is another of Plovdiv\u2019s strengths, and a new generation of restaurateurs are using local ingredients to turn out modern takes on traditional Bulgarian food. The hottest place in town is Pavaj (mains from \u00a36). Its young owners, Raycho Markov and Madlen Pakratyan, are obsessive about their trade, from growing rare heritage tomatoes in Markov\u2019s father\u2019s garden in the mountains to travelling the Balkans in search of great rakia (fruit brandy). Ask nicely and they may offer you samples from the restaurant\u2019s impressive collection. The food is simple and seasonal, from salads and meatballs to grilled sheep\u2019s cheese and bread made to Raycho\u2019s grandmother\u2019s recipe. The pillow-soft rolls are cut in half, fried in clarified butter and sprinkled with a salt and spice mix. It may just be the most addictive thing you try in Bulgaria. Be sure to book ahead. Another good option is the recently opened Aylyakriya, (Kozhukarska 3), also in Kapana, that does smart takes on traditional dishes, such as ka\u010damak (polenta), pork ribs and beans and an exceptional strawberry cheesecake (mains from around \u00a36). Restaurant with a view On the edge of the old town and overlooking the Kapana district, the shady terrace of Restaurant Philoppopolis (mains from about \u00a312) has one of the best views in the city (Philoppopolis was the ancient name for Plovdiv). The interior is in 1920s Viennese style and there is a gallery and museum in the same building. It\u2019s the most romantic place to eat in Plovdiv. A classy option in the centre of town is Hemingway Restaurant, which serves sophisticated Bulgarian and European dishes (mains from \u00a37). Buy local crafts Magura Street in Kapana is full of shops selling local crafts and souvenirs. There are places to buy handmade belts with ornate buckles and the pagan kukere masks worn by Bulgarians to scare off evil spirits during midwinter celebrations. Piuma D\u2019oro has beautiful sandals, leather bags and jewellery designed and handmade by its owner, Polina Kozarova. She worked as a shoe designer for 23 years before opening her own shop three years ago. For me this sums up the story of Kapana: it provides spaces for people to pursue their craft and sell what they make directly to customers. In the old town, the Street of Crafts, Stramna, is another place to buy local wares and see artisans at work in their studios. Climb the city hills Plovdiv was built on seven hills. There are actually only six now: one was quarried for materials to construct the city centuries ago. The most popular for tourists is Nebet Tepe, one of the three hills of the Old Town. The earliest archaeological remains date from 4,000BC (Plovdiv claims to be the oldest continually inhabited city in Europe). But Bunardzhik Tepe, also known as Alyosha Hill, with its huge Soviet soldier statue looming at the summit, is particularly special.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to help you start the week.</p> \n<p>At least three people are reported to have been killed and at least a 15 injured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/29/california-garlic-festival-shooting-police-casualties\">after a mass shooting at a food festival in California</a>. A suspected shooter was also shot dead after being engaged by police at the annual garlic festival in the agricultural town of Gilroy, less than two hours drive south of San Francisco. Videos posted on social media showed people at the festival running for cover as loud popping sounds are heard in the background. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d a woman can be heard asking. \u201cWho\u2019d shoot up a garlic festival?\u201d One survivor, Evenny Reyes, 13, told the San Jose Mercury News that at first she thought the gunfire was fireworks. Gilroy police chief Scot Smithee told a press conference that at least three people were killed. He said that dozens of officers were currently looking for a suspected second shooter but could not give any more details. It is believed the attacker or attackers cut through a security perimeter fence to bypass tight security at the event. California governor Gavin Newsom said his office was monitoring the situation closely. \u201cThis is nothing short of horrific,\u201d Newsom wrote on Twitter.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Brexit warning \u2013</strong> Boris Johnson has been warned that there is \u201cno such thing as a managed no deal\u201d Brexit and that his ambitious domestic agenda <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/28/boris-johnson-ifg-no-deal-brexit-crush-domestic-policy-plans\">would be crushed by the fallout of his \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d policy</a>. The Institute for Government (IfG) thinktank says that the integrity of the United Kingdom would come under \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with Northern Ireland worst affected. The prime minister would have to sepnd much of his time preserving the union, it said, adding that hard Brexiters were mistaken to think there could be a \u201cclean break\u201d from the EU. The warning comes as Johnson heads to Scotland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/28/boris-johnson-heads-to-scotland-to-deliver-300m-pledge\">offering a \u00a3300m package to boost the economy of the devolved nations</a>.

More than 4 million of them are in deep poverty, meaning their income is at least 50% below the official breadline, it said. Overall rates of poverty remain the same as they were nearly 20 years ago as governments of different colours failed to shift the problem. But the report also found that certain groups \u2013 such as children, children of lone parents, and pensioners \u2013 have seen hardship levels worsen since 2013 as a result of austerity measures such as the benefit freeze.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Manuhunt stepped up \u2013 </strong>Canadian police equipped with tracker dogs, drones and infrared search systems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/29/canada-manhunt-police-move-search-for-teen-suspects-after-tip-off\">have headed to the remote community of York Landing in Manitoba </a>after a sighting of the fugitives Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18. An indigenous patrol group spotted the pair who are wanted for the murder of an Australian man and his American girlfriend, as well as a Canadian man. They have been on the run for more than a week.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Who would shoot up a garlic festival?\u2019 Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to help you start the week. At least three people are reported to have been killed and at least a 15 injured after a mass shooting at a food festival in California. A suspected shooter was also shot dead after being engaged by police at the annual garlic festival in the agricultural town of Gilroy, less than two hours drive south of San Francisco. Videos posted on social media showed people at the festival running for cover as loud popping sounds are heard in the background. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d a woman can be heard asking. \u201cWho\u2019d shoot up a garlic festival?\u201d One survivor, Evenny Reyes, 13, told the San Jose Mercury News that at first she thought the gunfire was fireworks. Gilroy police chief Scot Smithee told a press conference that at least three people were killed. He said that dozens of officers were currently looking for a suspected second shooter but could not give any more details. It is believed the attacker or attackers cut through a security perimeter fence to bypass tight security at the event. California governor Gavin Newsom said his office was monitoring the situation closely. \u201cThis is nothing short of horrific,\u201d Newsom wrote on Twitter. * * * Brexit warning \u2013 Boris Johnson has been warned that there is \u201cno such thing as a managed no deal\u201d Brexit and that his ambitious domestic agenda would be crushed by the fallout of his \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d policy. The Institute for Government (IfG) thinktank says that the integrity of the United Kingdom would come under \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with Northern Ireland worst affected. The prime minister would have to sepnd much of his time preserving the union, it said, adding that hard Brexiters were mistaken to think there could be a \u201cclean break\u201d from the EU. The warning comes as Johnson heads to Scotland offering a \u00a3300m package to boost the economy of the devolved nations. But he faces a tough task to convince Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson to support crashing out of the EU without a deal. There was more bad news as Vauxhall owner PSA said the French company might be forced to close its Ellesmere Port factory if the UK did not reach a good deal when leaving the EU. Our columnist Matthew d\u2019Ancona writes today about the impact in Whitehall of Johnson\u2019s decision to appoint Dominic Cummings to his staff. The \u201cformidably clever\u201d Leave campaign mastermind apparently told a meeting of special advisers last week that their job was to deliver Brexit \u201cby any means necessary\u201d. * * * Poverty plague \u2013 Seven million people in the UK are trapped in persistent poverty, including 2.3 million children, according to a new report by the Social Metrics Commission. More than 4 million of them are in deep poverty, meaning their income is at least 50% below the official breadline, it said. Overall rates of poverty remain the same as they were nearly 20 years ago as governments of different colours failed to shift the problem. But the report also found that certain groups \u2013 such as children, children of lone parents, and pensioners \u2013 have seen hardship levels worsen since 2013 as a result of austerity measures such as the benefit freeze. * * * Manuhunt stepped up \u2013 Canadian police equipped with tracker dogs, drones and infrared search systems have headed to the remote community of York Landing in Manitoba after a sighting of the fugitives Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18. An indigenous patrol group spotted the pair who are wanted for the murder of an Australian man and his American girlfriend, as well as a Canadian man. They have been on the run for more than a week. Police warned residents of the area, which is 80km from the previous focus of the manhunt, Gillam, to stay inside and ensure all doors and windows are shut. * * * Hong Kong tension \u2013 Hong Kong was gripped by a tense calm today after another day of protests saw riot police use teargas and rubber bullets to control huge crowds marching through the city calling for political reforms. After a third day of protests on Sunday, all eyes are on Beijing today where it was expected that the Hong Kong and Macao affairs office \u2013 China\u2019s highest level body on the former British colony \u2013 will be holding a press conference this morning. It is believed to be the first time the unit has held a press briefing since Hong Kong was handed over to Beijing in 1997 and comes amid a flurry of condemnation of the protests from China\u2019s state media. * * * \u2018I relished the growling\u2019 \u2013 Households better get some extra food in for Christmas, because a very hungry guest is coming for tea. Channel 4 has announced that it has made a television version of the beloved children\u2019s book, The Tiger Who Came To Tea, which will be shown over the festive period. It will feature the voices of Benedict Cumberbatch, Tamsin Greig and David Oyelowo who says he \u201crelished all the growling, chomping and slurping\u201d. They will be joined by David Walliams as narrator. Today in Focus podcast: Jeff Bezos and the United States of Amazon In 1994, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, the company that has since made him the richest man in the world. Julia Carrie Wong charts the company\u2019s success and controversies. Lunchtime read: The unstoppable rise of Stacey Dooley Stacey Dooley is an unlikely globe-trotting documentary-maker. She left school in Luton at the age of 16 without any qualifications in a blur of drink, shoplifting and trunacy. But, as our interviewer Simon Hattenstone discovers, her strong work ethic, confidence and warm personality has been more than enough to secure a \u00a3250,000 deal with Panorama. She reveals how her tough upbringing prepared her for the job (I\u2019ve always been bloody-minded\u201d), how she copes with reporting from war zones (\u201cMy mind is clear\u201d), and why she\u2019s puzzled that the press are more interested in her love life after she moved in with her Strictly Come Dancing partner after winning the contest. Sport Egan Bernal rode on to the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es to become the first Colombian to win the Tour de France with his teammate and defending champion, Geraint Thomas, and his Ineos team chief, Dave Brailsford, expecting the 22-year-old to dominate the sport for years to come. Lewis Hamilton said he was at fault for the error that cost him the lead in Sunday\u2019s German Grand Prix and led him to finish ninth. A potential blockbuster bout between Brooks Koepka and Rory McIlroy turned instead into a technical knockout as the American clinched an emphatic three-stroke victory at the WGC-St Jude Invitational in Memphis. In France, Ko Jin-young won her second major title of the season after a slow burning but ultimately dramatic afternoon at the Evian Championship. England\u2019s bowler\u2019s have been unable to find a way to dismiss Meg Lanning since 2015 and nothing changed in the second Women\u2019s Ashes Twenty20 as the Australian captain led her side to another win over their beleaguered hosts. And Frank Lampard has urged Chelsea\u2019s fans to drop a chant that contains an offensive reference to the travelling community after his side continued their encouraging form with victory over Reading. Business Asian stock markets drifted lower overnight ahead of ther resumption of talks between US and Chinese trade negotiators tomorrow and Wednesday. However, there are no great hopes for a breakthrough after China expressed anger at weekend comments by Donald Trump criticising the World Trade Organisation for favouring developing countries.

      "bodyText": "We are going to close the liveblog, thanks for reading along. Our full story is here, as soon as there is more news from police about the search for Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky, we\u2019ll be back, check in for updates. An update from Manitoba police, who have warned York Landing residents to \u201cstay inside and check all doors and windows to ensure they are closed and locked\u201d. Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky are believed to have been spotted in York Landing, a town of roughly 450 people, 80km from Gillam, in Manitoba by the Bear Clan Patrol, an Indigenous patrol group who are based in the provincial capital of Winnipeg. Heavily armoured police have descended on the small town with tracker dogs, helicopters and drones and are searching for the pair. McLeod and Schmegelsky are suspected of killing Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, and US citizen Chynna Deese, 24, and have been charged with the death of Canadian, Leonard Dyck, 64. Residents were warned to stay indoors overnight, as the search for the two men continued. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed as night fell in Manitoba that the suspects had not yet been caught and that the search was continuing. They asked people not to post photos of their officers onto social media, for fear of jeopardising their operations. It\u2019s now 10pm in York Landing, Manitoba, and almost half an hour after sunset, so it will be interesting to see if/how the search continues overnight. We\u2019ll keep you updated if there\u2019s any news. Kat Eschner reports that the two men spotted by Bear Clan Patrol, the community-based policing group, appeared to be wearing the same clothing \u2013 Schemegelsky in a camouflage jacket and McLeod in a blue T-shirt \u2013 that they were pictured in six days ago in CCTV footage from a hardware store in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, according to News 1130. When the men were spotted, they ran into the trees, according to members of the Bear Clan Patrol. A little more about York Landing, the sight of police searches from Kat Eschner. The community of York Landing is approximately 11 sq km and has a population of 443 people, according to the 2016 census, and about 116 dwellings. It sits on the eastern bank of the Nelson River, which flows into Hudson\u2019s Bay. The pair were spotted by members of the Bear Clan Patrol, an Indigenous patrol group based in the provincial capital of Winnipeg that has been assisting community members in the Fox Lake Cree Nation, which is beside Gillam, and nearby communities, as the RCMP look for the fugitives. The last confirmed sighting of the pair was in Gillam, which has a population of approximately 1,300, spread out over a large area. York Landing is about 80km west of Gillam as the crow flies, but limited roads mean a trip by car takes several hours. An update from Leroy Constant, the chief of York Factory First Nation, who says the two suspects are still at large and that emergency teams are continuing ground searches with dogs and heavily armed officers. People in the area are being encouraged to remain indoors. There are a lot of unverified reports doing the rounds on social media that the pair have been caught. So far there have been no official or verified reports that this has occurred and the RCMP have not confirmed any arrests. We will be waiting until there is official confirmation. More about the sighting of McLeod and Schmegelsky from Alberni Valley News who report that the pair, who are suspected of murdering three people, were spotted scavenging food out of a dump: James Favel, the executive director of Bear Clan Patrol, said the group was asked by the York Factory First Nation to head up to York Landing in northern Manitoba watch out for the community. Bear Clan Patrol is a non-violent volunteer group originally founded in Winnipeg to provide security to the Indigenous community in 1992. Favel said seven members headed up to York Landing, a town of around 400 people, and spotted two strange men matching the descriptions of Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky near the dump around 4:15 p.m. local time. \u201cThey come across two men who meet the description of the two wanted suspects,\u201d Favel told Black Press Media by phone. \u201cThey appeared to be scavenging food out of the dump.\u201d Police have warned the public not to post photos of police operations in York Landing, for fear of jeopardising the operations there. Crisis negotiators, tracker dogs, and high-tech equipment including drones and infrared equipment are now moving towards York Landing, in pursuit of fugitives Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, after the pair were spotted by members of an Indigenous patrol group. A Facebook post by Leroy Constant, the elected chief of York Factory First Nation, called on residents in York Landing to \u201cremain indoors with your doors locked. All vehicles should be parked\u201d, it said. McLeod and Schmegelsky are suspected of killing Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, and US citizen Chynna Deese, 24, and have been charged with the death of Canadian, Leonard Dyck, 64. The fugitives were seen by members of the Bear Clan Patrol, who are based in the provincial capital of Winnipeg. The group has been assisting community members in the Fox Lake Cree Nation, which is next door to the remote community of Gillam, where the search has been focussed. On Sunday night, \u201cmultiple [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] resources\u201d were being sent to York Landing to investigate a tip that the pair are \u201cin, or near, the community,\u201d according to a tweet from Manitoba RCMP. \u201cA heavy police presence can be expected in the area,\u201d it said.",

I called the Sopra Steria support line and they suggested to keep checking the website for cancelled appointments. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the uncertainty of constantly checking the system with no guarantee of an appointment becoming available, so I elected to pay \u00a3100 for an appointment in Croydon, two hours away. Despite booking a timed appointment, there was a waiting time of an hour and then the system wasn\u2019t working properly leading to further delays.\u201d Free appointments are said to be between 10am and 4pm at the company\u2019s core centres, in Birmingham, Belfast, Cardiff, Croydon in south London, Glasgow and Manchester. In some other cities \u201cenhanced service points\u201d offer appointments for \u00a360 to \u00a3125, in many cases located in public libraries. \u201cAs a result, some students are paying to fast-track their appointments and travelling to one of Sopra Steria\u2019s centres, often many miles away from where they live,\u201d Universities UK said. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the \u201cshoddy\u201d service was the wrong way to treat students making significant educational and financial contributions to the UK. \u201cWhile other countries are falling over themselves to attract international students, this Tory government continues to subject them to a hostile environment,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cSopra Steria are yet another private contractor, like G4S and Serco, given millions in public funds by the Home Office, and providing a shoddy service.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said: \u201cSopra Steria is working closely with the Home Office, universities and higher education institutions across the UK to deliver the tier 4 visa application service. This is tailored to each institution\u2019s needs to provide greater student convenience and choice. \u201cWe are focused on adapting the service to respond to areas of greatest demand and are increasing capacity where needed.\u201d Other students have also said they couldn\u2019t access online appointments administered by Sopra Steria. Khalid Elkhereiji, a student at the University of Southampton who uses a screen reader to read onscreen text aloud, said it could not deal with parts of the online application. \u201cThis is not a problem that I face with other websites and it meant I was not able to log in without the assistance of a sighted person,\u201d Elkhereiji said. \u201cI have explained my concerns with the accessibility of the service to Sopra Steria and I believe it is a relatively simple issue to fix. However, I have not had any further updates from Sopra Steria and there has been no confirmation that their website is inclusive and accessible to everyone.\u201d After eventually logging on Elkhereiji found there were no appointments available in Southampton, and obtained one only after his university intervened. In 2017 Sopra Steria came under fire for its involvement in NHS Shared Business Services (SBS), a venture it co-owned with the Department of Health, after the Guardian revealed that more than 500,000 pieces of sensitive medical correspondence handled by SBS had gone missing.",

Where once, even in the heart of the city, there was usually a grassy bank he could moor next to, there are now just smooth concrete slabs. Residential moorings have been taken over by businesses running bar barges and restaurant boats, and tall glass buildings have sprung up on the waterside, overshadowing the water. \u201cNo mooring here,\u201d the signs say.</p> \n<p>But for Trower, it is the level of abuse he receives in central London that makes him feel most unwelcome. \u201cIt ranges from being called a pikey to having stones thrown at my boat.\u201d</p> \n<p>The vast majority of London\u2019s \u201ccontinuous cruisers\u201d \u2013 boaters like Trower who live on the city\u2019s canals but move around regularly so they are not obliged to pay for an expensive permanent mooring \u2013 get harassed by local residents nowadays, he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a326099ce1f2d838bbb5760f6f888e8dca03bfb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a326099ce1f2d838bbb5760f6f888e8dca03bfb/0_367_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Trower, from the National Bargee Travellers Association, with his son, Cillian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Marcus Trower, from the National Bargee Travellers Association, with his son, Cillian.

Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic \u2013 and newly costly.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>As commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain\u2019s cities, Guardian Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.</p>\n    <p><b>Chris Michael, Cities editor</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>London\u2019s canals are being gentrified, he says: since the city hosted the Olympics in 2012, the character of formerly neglected areas of London by the canal has changed, with King\u2019s Cross, Hackney Wick and Paddington undergoing particularly dramatic transformations. And while continuous cruisers get away with paying as little as \u00a320,000 for their floating homes, a tiny canalside flat in these newly popular locations can <a href=\"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-66999064.html\">now cost nearly \u00a31m</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>They don\u2019t want boats there \u2013 or maybe they only want to see a certain type of boat</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Marcus Trower</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Trower, a spokesperson for the National Bargee Travellers Association (NBTA), thinks it is this economic disparity that is fuelling the conflict on the canals: \u201cLife is hard on the water, but it\u2019s obviously cheaper. Maybe they\u2019re jealous of us. And when they look out of their posh, clean, clinical-looking flats, I think they want their view of the canal to look a certain way: pristine. They don\u2019t want boats there \u2013 or maybe they only want to see a certain type of boat.\u201d There are parts of central London he no longer moors in that he once called home.</p> \n<p>Graham Ryder, 45, a plumber who has been continuously cruising on London\u2019s canals for five years, also feels he is being displaced. \u201cThe waterways are being sold off to businesses. There are fewer and fewer places for us to moor, and more business boats. Property developers are taking away the rings we need to moor our boats on the canal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both Ryder and Trower feel the Canal &amp; River Trust (CRT), the charity responsible for maintaining the waterways in England and Wales, is part of the problem. The CRT issues the continuous cruising licences for London\u2019s canals and owns about 40% of the city\u2019s permanent moorings, which it leases off to the highest bidder at auctions. As a result, permanent moorings in London can cost as much as \u00a320,000 a year and are rarely affordable for continuous cruisers. By contrast, cruising licences cost less than \u00a31,250 a year and allow boaters to moor for free anywhere along the towpath for up to 14 days \u2013 as long as they can find a space.</p> \n<p>And that is much more difficult than it used to be. As the price of property on land in London has risen to <a href=\"https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/ratio-house-prices-earnings-borough\">more than 14.5 times the average salary</a> and neighbourhoods by the canals have become more fashionable, the number of continuous cruising licences issued by the CRT \u2013 and the number of people competing for places to moor \u2013 has dramatically increased. In 2012, only 638 continuous cruising licences were issued. By 2019, this number had soared to 2,208, a 246% increase. In total, the number of boats on London\u2019s canals \u2013 including those with permanent moorings \u2013 has nearly doubled over the past seven years.</p> \n<p>When Delta Gomersall, 26, moved to London from South Africa in 2016, she was shocked at the cost of renting and moved straight onto a boat. \u201cI was mortified, especially when I saw the ratio of rents to salary. I wasn\u2019t in a house for the first year and a bit that I was in the country. It never became affordable to move into a place, even when I started working.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0906243907e6a8b4d427068a10c739004b82028b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0906243907e6a8b4d427068a10c739004b82028b/0_17_5618_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A floating hot tub makes its way along the Regent\u2019s canal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A floating hot tub makes its way along the Regent\u2019s canal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RichardBaker/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>A floating hot tub makes its way along the Regent\u2019s canal. Photograph: Richard Baker/Alamy</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Gomersall, who works in recruitment and now lives in Birmingham, says the practice of using auctions for permanent moorings and the tighter restrictions for continuous cruisers are making boating more difficult and expensive.</p> \n<p>Many of the newcomers are young professionals, according to Trower. \u201cThey cram into central London \u2013 you see boats double moored or even triple moored. They\u2019re all young, new to the water.\u201d There are fewer older, experienced continuous cruisers in the city nowadays, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the diversity you did before.\u201d</p> \n<p>The regeneration and growth in popularity of London\u2019s canals has also coincided with a huge jump in the CRT\u2019s earnings. Over the past five years alone, its annual income has risen by 25% to \u00a3204.9m.</p> \n<p>Recently, it sold off 12 mooring spaces in Paddington, King\u2019s Cross and Hackney Wick that were previously used by continuous cruisers. The new occupants of these permanent commercial moorings include leisure boat businesses, a bookshop, a restaurant and bar, and a floating community centre operated by a church.</p> \n<p>The CRT has also restricted boats from running their diesel engines and banned them from burning anything in their stoves that gives off smoke in a newly created <a href=\"https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/news-and-views/news/eco-mooring-zone-in-development-in-islington\">eco-mooring</a> zone of the canal in Islington. The NBTA say this restriction, which makes it difficult and potentially more expensive for the boaters to heat their homes, amounts to \u201csocial exclusion eco-style\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6290330387ee4704c095c354cdb6ef88cc263481\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6290330387ee4704c095c354cdb6ef88cc263481/0_43_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canalside homes along Hertford Union Canal by Victoria Park in Hackney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Canalside homes along Hertford Union Canal by Victoria Park in Hackney.

We want everybody to be able to enjoy the canals and in one section we are asking people to think about how they can make a greater contribution to the environment.\u201d He said the CRT had installed rings into concrete by canals to create about 57 new moorings for continuous cruisers in Hackney and is investing in new facilities for boaters further out of the city. He added that the CRT does not allow developers to take rings away and privatise the towpath. \u201cNo mooring\u201d signs were either being put up on privately owned land or because the CRT needs to ensure boats can safely navigate the waterway, as congestion on the canal increases.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I worry some of the character of the place will be lost. But on the other hand, more people are aware of this amazing location</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Simon Ryder, The Floating Classroom</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>However, he would not rule out selling off further mooring spaces along the towpath to businesses, pointing out that businesses bring in thousands of new people to the canals. \u201cThe canal is now a focal point, a destination. Before businesses got involved with regenerating areas ... parts of the canal were no-go areas because of crime.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tommo Stuart Thomson has set up two businesses on the canals in the past two years: Barge East, a bar and restaurant barge permanently moored in Hackney Wick, and SkunaBoats, which rents out floating hot tubs in Islington, typically to people in their mid-30s. Thomson, who once spent a year living as a continuous cruiser on London\u2019s canals, says: \u201cWe\u2019re attracting all sorts of people who would never visit the canal; lots of tourists from central London hotels and diners who traditionally wouldn\u2019t travel to east London.\u201d</p> \n<p>The canals, he points out, were originally built for commercial operations - so businesses using the canals to make money is nothing new. He perceives the canals as valuable spaces for people in the city to unwind, not just to live. He does not think they are being gentrified: \u201cThere is still such a mix of people from all walks of life and you only have to walk along the canal to see that. \u201d </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/25/the-canal-revolution-how-waterways-reveal-the-truth-about-modern-britain\">The canal revolution: how waterways reveal the truth about modern Britain</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Formerly quiet areas of the canal in Paddington have become much livelier in the evenings, attracting more diverse, younger crowds, says Simon Ryder, who runs the charity The Floating Classroom, teaching local children about the ecology and heritage of the canals from a barge moored there.\u201cOver the last three or four decades, the canal has been a semi-secret place, a haven for people who aren\u2019t comfortable living elsewhere, and I worry that some of the character of the place will be lost. But on the other hand, way more people are aware of this amazing location we\u2019ve got in London and how special it is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Graham Ryder accepts the need to share the canal with other users, but feels angry that his way of life is being eroded. \u201cThe canal is a protected public asset. It was rebuilt by volunteers when it fell into disrepair. Our community of boats made it safe. And now it\u2019s economically viable for business, they want to flog it. The last bit of green countryside in London is being lost.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/canal-revolution\">canal revolution series</a> looks at what our changing waterways reveal about modern British cities.

      "bodyText": "Marcus Trower has seen a lot of changes to London\u2019s canals over the eight years he has lived on his boat. Where once, even in the heart of the city, there was usually a grassy bank he could moor next to, there are now just smooth concrete slabs. Residential moorings have been taken over by businesses running bar barges and restaurant boats, and tall glass buildings have sprung up on the waterside, overshadowing the water. \u201cNo mooring here,\u201d the signs say. But for Trower, it is the level of abuse he receives in central London that makes him feel most unwelcome. \u201cIt ranges from being called a pikey to having stones thrown at my boat.\u201d The vast majority of London\u2019s \u201ccontinuous cruisers\u201d \u2013 boaters like Trower who live on the city\u2019s canals but move around regularly so they are not obliged to pay for an expensive permanent mooring \u2013 get harassed by local residents nowadays, he says. Marcus Trower, from the National Bargee Travellers Association, with his son, Cillian. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/the Guardian \u201cThey just don\u2019t like us. I think it\u2019s a lot to do with the developments in these areas. You don\u2019t get harassed as much in areas which are not being developed.\u201d London\u2019s canals are being gentrified, he says: since the city hosted the Olympics in 2012, the character of formerly neglected areas of London by the canal has changed, with King\u2019s Cross, Hackney Wick and Paddington undergoing particularly dramatic transformations. And while continuous cruisers get away with paying as little as \u00a320,000 for their floating homes, a tiny canalside flat in these newly popular locations can now cost nearly \u00a31m. Trower, a spokesperson for the National Bargee Travellers Association (NBTA), thinks it is this economic disparity that is fuelling the conflict on the canals: \u201cLife is hard on the water, but it\u2019s obviously cheaper. Maybe they\u2019re jealous of us. And when they look out of their posh, clean, clinical-looking flats, I think they want their view of the canal to look a certain way: pristine. They don\u2019t want boats there \u2013 or maybe they only want to see a certain type of boat.\u201d There are parts of central London he no longer moors in that he once called home. Graham Ryder, 45, a plumber who has been continuously cruising on London\u2019s canals for five years, also feels he is being displaced. \u201cThe waterways are being sold off to businesses. There are fewer and fewer places for us to moor, and more business boats. Property developers are taking away the rings we need to moor our boats on the canal.\u201d Both Ryder and Trower feel the Canal &amp; River Trust (CRT), the charity responsible for maintaining the waterways in England and Wales, is part of the problem. The CRT issues the continuous cruising licences for London\u2019s canals and owns about 40% of the city\u2019s permanent moorings, which it leases off to the highest bidder at auctions. As a result, permanent moorings in London can cost as much as \u00a320,000 a year and are rarely affordable for continuous cruisers. By contrast, cruising licences cost less than \u00a31,250 a year and allow boaters to moor for free anywhere along the towpath for up to 14 days \u2013 as long as they can find a space. And that is much more difficult than it used to be. As the price of property on land in London has risen to more than 14.5 times the average salary and neighbourhoods by the canals have become more fashionable, the number of continuous cruising licences issued by the CRT \u2013 and the number of people competing for places to moor \u2013 has dramatically increased. In 2012, only 638 continuous cruising licences were issued. By 2019, this number had soared to 2,208, a 246% increase. In total, the number of boats on London\u2019s canals \u2013 including those with permanent moorings \u2013 has nearly doubled over the past seven years. When Delta Gomersall, 26, moved to London from South Africa in 2016, she was shocked at the cost of renting and moved straight onto a boat. \u201cI was mortified, especially when I saw the ratio of rents to salary. I wasn\u2019t in a house for the first year and a bit that I was in the country. It never became affordable to move into a place, even when I started working.\u201d A floating hot tub makes its way along the Regent\u2019s canal. Photograph: Richard Baker/Alamy Gomersall, who works in recruitment and now lives in Birmingham, says the practice of using auctions for permanent moorings and the tighter restrictions for continuous cruisers are making boating more difficult and expensive. Many of the newcomers are young professionals, according to Trower. \u201cThey cram into central London \u2013 you see boats double moored or even triple moored. They\u2019re all young, new to the water.\u201d There are fewer older, experienced continuous cruisers in the city nowadays, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the diversity you did before.\u201d The regeneration and growth in popularity of London\u2019s canals has also coincided with a huge jump in the CRT\u2019s earnings. Over the past five years alone, its annual income has risen by 25% to \u00a3204.9m. Recently, it sold off 12 mooring spaces in Paddington, King\u2019s Cross and Hackney Wick that were previously used by continuous cruisers. The new occupants of these permanent commercial moorings include leisure boat businesses, a bookshop, a restaurant and bar, and a floating community centre operated by a church. The CRT has also restricted boats from running their diesel engines and banned them from burning anything in their stoves that gives off smoke in a newly created eco-mooring zone of the canal in Islington. The NBTA say this restriction, which makes it difficult and potentially more expensive for the boaters to heat their homes, amounts to \u201csocial exclusion eco-style\u201d. Canalside homes along Hertford Union Canal by Victoria Park in Hackney. Photograph: Gregory Wrona/Alamy Sorwar Ahmed, who leads the CRT\u2019s London boating team, argues that boaters need to \u201cdo their bit to be good neighbours. We want everybody to be able to enjoy the canals and in one section we are asking people to think about how they can make a greater contribution to the environment.\u201d He said the CRT had installed rings into concrete by canals to create about 57 new moorings for continuous cruisers in Hackney and is investing in new facilities for boaters further out of the city. He added that the CRT does not allow developers to take rings away and privatise the towpath. \u201cNo mooring\u201d signs were either being put up on privately owned land or because the CRT needs to ensure boats can safely navigate the waterway, as congestion on the canal increases. However, he would not rule out selling off further mooring spaces along the towpath to businesses, pointing out that businesses bring in thousands of new people to the canals. \u201cThe canal is now a focal point, a destination. Before businesses got involved with regenerating areas ... parts of the canal were no-go areas because of crime.\u201d Tommo Stuart Thomson has set up two businesses on the canals in the past two years: Barge East, a bar and restaurant barge permanently moored in Hackney Wick, and SkunaBoats, which rents out floating hot tubs in Islington, typically to people in their mid-30s. Thomson, who once spent a year living as a continuous cruiser on London\u2019s canals, says: \u201cWe\u2019re attracting all sorts of people who would never visit the canal; lots of tourists from central London hotels and diners who traditionally wouldn\u2019t travel to east London.\u201d The canals, he points out, were originally built for commercial operations - so businesses using the canals to make money is nothing new. He perceives the canals as valuable spaces for people in the city to unwind, not just to live. He does not think they are being gentrified: \u201cThere is still such a mix of people from all walks of life and you only have to walk along the canal to see that. \u201d Formerly quiet areas of the canal in Paddington have become much livelier in the evenings, attracting more diverse, younger crowds, says Simon Ryder, who runs the charity The Floating Classroom, teaching local children about the ecology and heritage of the canals from a barge moored there.\u201cOver the last three or four decades, the canal has been a semi-secret place, a haven for people who aren\u2019t comfortable living elsewhere, and I worry that some of the character of the place will be lost. But on the other hand, way more people are aware of this amazing location we\u2019ve got in London and how special it is.\u201d Graham Ryder accepts the need to share the canal with other users, but feels angry that his way of life is being eroded. \u201cThe canal is a protected public asset. It was rebuilt by volunteers when it fell into disrepair. Our community of boats made it safe. And now it\u2019s economically viable for business, they want to flog it. The last bit of green countryside in London is being lost.\u201d The canal revolution series looks at what our changing waterways reveal about modern British cities.

For Burns, this was the only place to begin his grand project of historical self-analysis. \u201cIt was,\u201d he says, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/american-civil-war\">the greatest existential threat to the United States</a>. We had been founded in 1776 on the assumption that all men are created equal. But \u2013 four score and five years later \u2013 four million Americans were owned by other Americans.\u201d</p> <p>Critics, with their cataloguing habits, have assumed that Burns set out to create a war trilogy. But the film-maker protests: \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t. There\u2019s been no agenda. I have been drawn to subjects completely emotionally: I\u2019m finishing something up and my eye is drawn to something else. When The Civil War series was finished, it had been so emotionally wrenching to work on that story \u2013 even though we were at a remove of 150 years \u2013 that I vowed never to do another film on war. Then I realised that my next series, Baseball, was actually a sequel to The Civil War. Although people always look at me as if I\u2019m crazy when I say that.\u201d</p> <p>Such looks are echoed in my bemused silence down a phone line to Burns\u2019 office in New Hampshire. He explains, though, that \u201cthe first real progress with regard to race after the Civil War\u201d came when, on 14 April 1947, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/11/ken-burns-jackie-robinson-baseball-civil-rights-documentary\">Jackie Robinson walked out for the Brooklyn Dodgers as the first African American to play Major League Baseball</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"22898eb561bca768538a2b264a750e0585295410\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22898eb561bca768538a2b264a750e0585295410/0_686_7524_5401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milestone moment \u2026 Jackie Robinson in Burns\u2019s film Baseball.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milestone moment \u2026 Jackie Robinson in Burns\u2019s film Baseball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Working on Baseball, Burns decided that the best musical soundtrack for that story was jazz: \u201cAnd I realised that \u2013 though I had grown up listening to jazz, which my father enjoyed \u2013 I was woefully ignorant about what it was, and its racial significance. So, for me, Civil War, Baseball and Jazz are a sort of war trilogy.\u201d</p> <p>When Jazz was released in 2001, Burns was still expecting to stick to his pledge never formally to document another American conflict. \u201cThen I learned that 1,000 Americans a day, veterans of the second world war, were dying, and I realised those memories were quickly going to disappear. I also discovered that many, many high-school students thought we fought with the Germans against the Russians. I was so stunned at that gross ignorance that I decided to do the world war two film. Then, even before we had finished that project, I had decided to do Vietnam, which took almost 11 years.\u201d</p> <p>The projects take so long because of the exhaustive collection of material \u2013 \u201cFor Country Music, I had 101 interviews, representing 175 hours of conversation, and 1,500 photographs\u201d \u2013 and the perfectionist assemblage of the final film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c71fb272b1c1ba65e0e0580f494fbb6f9287f10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c71fb272b1c1ba65e0e0580f494fbb6f9287f10/0_318_2681_1204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I was woefully ignorant about what it was\u2019 \u2026 Burns\u2019s documentary Jazz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"449\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was woefully ignorant about what it was\u2019 \u2026 Burns\u2019s documentary Jazz.

We never stop researching, never stop reading, looking for photographs, writing. Nothing is set in stone. I\u2019ve got a neon sign, in cursive script, in my editing room that reads: It\u2019s Complicated. Although most of the process of editing is by nature subtractive, often the last thing we do in the editing room is add something.\u201d</p> <p>Rewatching <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70202577\">The Civil War</a> after having seen <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80997770?source=35\">The Vietnam War</a>, I was struck, in retrospect, by how audacious Burns had been to make the earlier series with none of the elements \u2013 living witnesses, contemporary news footage \u2013 that helped to make the latter so impressive. Had he worried at the time about filling 11 and half hours of TV with a story from a pre-cinematic era? \u201cAbraham Lincoln, faced with a whole string of second-rate, inferior generals, said, \u2018We must use the tools we have.\u2019 Each film has been an exercise in saying, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019 Sometimes, there can be a tyranny towards too much footage. Sometimes, in Vietnam and Baseball, we used still photographs, even though film was available.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09362f235ae47963cabcee308c9086679cda3471\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09362f235ae47963cabcee308c9086679cda3471/0_43_1831_1233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audacious film-making \u2026 Union army general Ulysses S Grant in The Civil War.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audacious film-making \u2026 Union army general Ulysses S Grant in The Civil War.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CS Associates/PBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burns is nervous of formulas for film-making. \u201cI see style as the authentic application of technique. And there are dozens of techniques that might be employed. Put simply, I have eight basic elements at my disposal: four visual, four aural. At any time, we have the possibility of \u2013 visually \u2013 interviews, or \u2018talking heads\u2019, live cinematography, still photographs, motion pictures. Aurally, we will have a third-person narrator; a chorus of third person voices, reading the journals or love letters of the period; a complex Hollywood-style sound-effects track; and music, which is recorded before the editing.\u201d</p> <p>Availability, though, should not mandate use. The first three images in Country Music, documenting a subject with a vast film and TV archive, are two still photos and a painting. Jazz and Country Music have another technical departure: \u201cIn documentary film-making, music is usually this important thing, but always in the background. So there is a beautiful shock in the music suddenly reaching this hyper-ground right in front of you. It happened to us several times while editing Jazz and Country Music.\u201d</p> <p>A measure of Burns\u2019 meticulousness is his attitude to \u201clower thirds\u201d, the captions at the bottom of a screen, identifying speakers. Burns gives the job that they held at the point in the narrative we have reached, so newspaper reporters who later became celebrated novelists are identified with the job title on their press card at the time. That\u2019s presumably a way of avoiding hindsight and keeping in the present tense. \u201cAbsolutely. In the world war two series, we interviewed a woman who was a widow, but we used her maiden name because, at that point, she was the sister of brothers we were talking about. It\u2019s only in the final episode of the film, when she gets married, that we use her married name.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1fd8e4b14148b1531c016f3c9b40b391a4a2de22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fd8e4b14148b1531c016f3c9b40b391a4a2de22/0_0_6000_4637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Monroe on stage at the Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, c.1958.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"773\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Monroe on stage at the Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, c.1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Les Leverett Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first episode of Country Music, which charts the geographical spread of the form, even superstars are identified by where they come from (\u201cDolly Parton, Tennessee\u201d), rather than who they are.</p> <p>Yet, even for a producer as scrupulous as Burns, there is the challenge of living in an era when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">President Trump</a> has pioneered the idea of \u201calternative facts\u201d, and online posters increasingly regard history and news as a matter of opinion. Is that worrying for a maker of history documentaries? \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly worrying as a citizen of the world, where we see not just the willingness of people to engage in dissembling, but the technological ability to do so. But a huge majority of your readers \u2013 and my viewers \u2013 are still interested in fact.</p> <p>\u201cIn anticipation of what we thought would be our most controversial film, The Vietnam War, we assembled what we called our war room of Republicans and Democrats on different sides of the debate, who were skilled in putting out fires. We did not need to use them because we were so fiercely loyal to facts. If you do that, people trust you. We tried to show that there can be more than one truth in war.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6d5fefe3c293365fbdd26b8168993ce783199af4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d5fefe3c293365fbdd26b8168993ce783199af4/0_294_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What it\u2019s like to be on the battlefield \u2026 from Burns\u2019s film about the second world war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What it\u2019s like to be on the battlefield \u2026 from Burns\u2019s film about the second world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an address to the graduating class at Stanford University in California in 2016, shortly before Trump became the Republican nominee, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtnXbL2wwdM\">Burns warned</a> that the reality-TV star had \u201ca total lack of historical awareness, a political paranoia that, predictably, points fingers, always making the other wrong \u2026 The sense of commonwealth, of shared sacrifice, of trust, so much a part of American life, is eroding fast, spurred along and amplified by an amoral internet that permits a lie to circle the globe three times before the truth can get started.\u201d</p> <p>Three years on, Burns says: \u201cEverything I said, I\u2019m so very sorry to say, has come true.\u201d But, as a historian, does he see the 45th president as an aberration or a continuation? \u201cI think he is without precedent, which is what makes him so dangerous. And yet he is the embodiment of certain tendencies and attitudes that have been present throughout our history \u2013 anti-immigration, anti-black, sort of proto-fascist, dissembling, all of that. We\u2019ve just never had it so glaringly in a chief executive. And it seems to be what\u2019s in the drinking water of the Earth at the moment as you watch the ascension of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-becomes-pm-with-promise-of-brexit-by-31-october\">Boris Johnson</a>, the rise of dictators in Turkey and Hungary and the Philippines. There is a tendency to suggest that you can be expedient with the truth \u2013 and I don\u2019t think you can.\u201d</p> <p>Burns\u2019 accidental war trilogy is about to become an informal quartet, with a planned series about the American revolutionary wars of 1775-83. \u201cI don\u2019t want, as we tend to do in this country, to make it a superficial, sanitised event among a few dozen white men in Philadelphia, but to cover everything that was going on from New Hampshire to Georgia, the people who stayed loyal to Great Britain, African-Americans, British soldiers, American officers. And so, despite constantly never wanting to make another war film, I keep doing so because it is where human beings reveal themselves most prominently \u2013 for good or ill.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Ken Burns Day is on <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/\">PBS</a> on 29 July. <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/\">Country Music is broadcast on PBS from 15 September</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many birthday presents are rapidly discarded or forgotten, but a gift given to a 17-year-old Michigan high-school student, on 29 July 1970, changed American television. Ken Burns received an 8mm movie camera, the first step on a path that made him such a revered figure in documentary film-making that, five decades later, his birthday this year will be celebrated with a whole day of his work on the PBS network. If 66 seems an odd birthday to be so honoured, it is because, on the more conventional landmark last year, Burns was locked away editing his latest eight-part, 16-hour series, Country Music, which airs in September. That work forms, with Baseball and Jazz, a loose trilogy about emblematically American sports and culture. Those series are a peacetime balance to another thematic trio: The Civil War, The War and The Vietnam War, grippingly authoritative revisitings of the conflicts in which America was engaged between 1861-65, 1941-45, and 1954-73. What had Burns learned from selecting his retrospective? \u201cWhile the stories I have told stretch from the 18th century to the 21st, all asked one deceptively simple question: who are we? That strange and very complicated people who like to call ourselves Americans.

In the world war two series, we interviewed a woman who was a widow, but we used her maiden name because, at that point, she was the sister of brothers we were talking about. It\u2019s only in the final episode of the film, when she gets married, that we use her married name.\u201d In the first episode of Country Music, which charts the geographical spread of the form, even superstars are identified by where they come from (\u201cDolly Parton, Tennessee\u201d), rather than who they are. Yet, even for a producer as scrupulous as Burns, there is the challenge of living in an era when President Trump has pioneered the idea of \u201calternative facts\u201d, and online posters increasingly regard history and news as a matter of opinion. Is that worrying for a maker of history documentaries? \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly worrying as a citizen of the world, where we see not just the willingness of people to engage in dissembling, but the technological ability to do so. But a huge majority of your readers \u2013 and my viewers \u2013 are still interested in fact. \u201cIn anticipation of what we thought would be our most controversial film, The Vietnam War, we assembled what we called our war room of Republicans and Democrats on different sides of the debate, who were skilled in putting out fires. We did not need to use them because we were so fiercely loyal to facts. If you do that, people trust you. We tried to show that there can be more than one truth in war.\u201d In an address to the graduating class at Stanford University in California in 2016, shortly before Trump became the Republican nominee, Burns warned that the reality-TV star had \u201ca total lack of historical awareness, a political paranoia that, predictably, points fingers, always making the other wrong \u2026 The sense of commonwealth, of shared sacrifice, of trust, so much a part of American life, is eroding fast, spurred along and amplified by an amoral internet that permits a lie to circle the globe three times before the truth can get started.\u201d Three years on, Burns says: \u201cEverything I said, I\u2019m so very sorry to say, has come true.\u201d But, as a historian, does he see the 45th president as an aberration or a continuation? \u201cI think he is without precedent, which is what makes him so dangerous. And yet he is the embodiment of certain tendencies and attitudes that have been present throughout our history \u2013 anti-immigration, anti-black, sort of proto-fascist, dissembling, all of that. We\u2019ve just never had it so glaringly in a chief executive. And it seems to be what\u2019s in the drinking water of the Earth at the moment as you watch the ascension of Boris Johnson, the rise of dictators in Turkey and Hungary and the Philippines. There is a tendency to suggest that you can be expedient with the truth \u2013 and I don\u2019t think you can.\u201d Burns\u2019 accidental war trilogy is about to become an informal quartet, with a planned series about the American revolutionary wars of 1775-83. \u201cI don\u2019t want, as we tend to do in this country, to make it a superficial, sanitised event among a few dozen white men in Philadelphia, but to cover everything that was going on from New Hampshire to Georgia, the people who stayed loyal to Great Britain, African-Americans, British soldiers, American officers. And so, despite constantly never wanting to make another war film, I keep doing so because it is where human beings reveal themselves most prominently \u2013 for good or ill.\u201d \u2022 Ken Burns Day is on PBS on 29 July. Country Music is broadcast on PBS from 15 September.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>What is facial recognition?</strong></h2> <p>Facial recognition technology has spread prodigiously. It\u2019s there on Facebook, tagging photos from the class reunion, your cousin\u2019s wedding and the office summer party. Google, Microsoft, Apple and others have built it into apps to compile albums of people who hang out together.</p> <p>It verifies who you are at airports and is the latest biometric to unlock your mobile phone where facial recognition apps abound. Need to confirm your identity for a \u00a31,000 bank transfer? Just look into the camera.</p> <p>New applications crop up all the time. Want to know who\u2019s at the door? A video doorbell with facial recognition will tell you, provided you\u2019ve uploaded a photo of the person\u2019s face. Other systems are used to spot missing persons and catch slackers who lie about the hours they spend in the office. Advertisers, of course, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/24/are-you-being-scanned-how-facial-recognition-technology-follows-you-even-as-you-shop\">in on the act</a>. Thanks to facial recognition, billboards can now serve up ads based on an estimate of your sex, age and mood.</p> <h2><strong>That sounds quite Big Brother. Is it a surveillance tool?</strong></h2> <p>Sometimes, yes. China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/apr/11/china-hi-tech-war-on-muslim-minority-xinjiang-uighurs-surveillance-face-recognition\">uses facial recognition </a>for racial profiling and its tracking and control of the Uighur muslims has been roundly condemned as a shameful first for a government.Its cameras also spot and fine jaywalkers, verify students at school gates, and monitor their expressions in lessons to ensure they are paying attention.</p> <p>Russia has embraced the technology too. In Moscow, video cameras scan the streets for \u201cpeople of interest\u201d and plans have been mooted to equip the police with glasses that work the same way.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-this-israeli-face-recognition-startup-is-secretly-tracking-palestinians-1.7500359\">There have been reports</a> that Israel is using facial recognition for covert tracking of Palestinians deep inside the West Bank. Meanwhile in Britain, the Metropolitan and South Wales police forces have trialled facial recognition to find people in football and rugby crowds, on city streets, and at commemorations and music festivals. Taylor Swift even installed the tech at a gig in California to weed out stalkers.</p> <p>Shops are increasingly installing the technology to deter and catch thieves. Next year, it will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo.</p> <h2><strong>How did it get everywhere?</strong></h2> <p>Advances in three technical fields have played a major part: big data, deep convolutional neural networks and powerful graphics processing units or GPUs.</p> <p>Thanks to Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, Google and others, the internet holds billions of photos of people\u2019s faces which have been scraped together into massive image datasets. They are used to train deep neural networks, a mainstay of modern artificial intelligence, to detect and recognise faces. The computational grunt work is often done on GPUs, the superfast chips that are dedicated to graphics processing. But there is more to it than flashy new technology. Over the past decade in particular, facial recognition systems have been deployed all over the place, and the data gathered from them has helped companies hone their technology.</p> <h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2> <p>First off, the computer has to learn what a face is. This can be done by training an algorithm, usually a deep neural network, on a vast number of photos that have faces in known positions. Each time the algorithm is presented with an image, it estimates where the face is. The network will be rubbish at first, like a drunk playing pin the tail on the donkey. But if this is done multiple times, the algorithm improves and eventually masters the art of spotting a face. This is the face detection step.</p> <p>Next up is the recognition part. This is done in various ways, but it\u2019s common to use a second neural network. It is fed a series of face pictures and learns \u2013 over many rounds \u2013 how best to tell one from another. Some algorithms explicitly map the face, measuring the distances between the eyes, nose and mouth and so on. Others map the face using more abstract features. Either way, the network outputs a vector for each face \u2013 a string of numbers that uniquely identifies the person among all the others in the training set.</p> <p>In live deployments, the software goes to work on video footage in real time. The computer scans frames of video usually captured at crowd pinch points, such as entrances to football stadiums. It first detects the faces in a frame, then churns out vectors for each one. The face vectors are then checked against those for people on a watchlist. Any matches that clear a preset threshold are then ranked and displayed. In the British police trials a typical threshold for a match was 60%, but the bar can be set higher to reduce false positives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/facerec-zip/giv-3902ACVhTqLxB5j4/\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/facerec-zip/giv-3902ACVhTqLxB5j4/\">graphic</a> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not the only way the police use facial recognition. If a suspect has been picked up, officers can upload their mugshot and search CCTV footage to potentially trace the suspect\u2019s movements back to the scene of a crime.</p> <h2><strong>How accurate is it?</strong></h2> <p>The best systems are impressive. <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/11/nist-evaluation-shows-advance-face-recognition-softwares-capabilities\">Independent tests</a> by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist) found that between 2014 and 2018 facial recognition systems got 20 times better at finding a match in a database of 12m portrait photos. The failure rate fell from 4% to 0.2% over the period, a massive gain in accuracy that was largely down to deep neural networks. Nist says the networks have driven \u201can industrial revolution\u201d in facial recognition.</p> <p>But such great performance depends on ideal conditions: where a crisp and clear mugshot of an unknown person is checked against a database of other high quality photos. In the real world, images can be blurred or poorly lit, people look away from the camera, or may have a scarf over their face, or be much older than in their reference photo. All tend to reduce the accuracy.</p> <p>The technology has a terrible time with twins, the Nist tests found, with even the best algorithms muddling them up.</p> <h2><strong>What about bias?</strong></h2> <p>Bias has long plagued facial recognition algorithms. The problem comes about when neural networks are trained on different numbers of faces from different groups of people. So if a system is trained on a million white male faces, but fewer women and people of colour, it will be less accurate for the latter groups. Less accuracy means more misidentifications and potentially more people being wrongly stopped and questioned.</p> <p>Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/26/amazon-facial-rekognition-congress-mugshots-aclu\">Amazon\u2019s Rekognition software</a> wrongly identified 28 members of Congress as people who had previously been arrested. It disproportionately misidentified African-Americans and Latinos. Amazon said the ACLU had used the wrong settings.</p> <p>Police trials have highlighted further shortcomings of facial recognition. A Cardiff University review of the South Wales trials found that the force\u2019s NEC NeoFace system froze, lagged and crashed when the screen was full of people and performed worse on gloomy days and in the late afternoon because the cameras ramped up their light sensitivity, making footage more \u201cnoisy\u201d.</p> <p>During 55 hours of deployment the system flagged up 2,900 potential matches of which 2,755 were false positives. The police made 18 arrests using the system, but the Cardiff report does not state whether any of the individuals were charged.</p> <p>The Welsh trial highlighted another challenge for facial recognition: lambs. Not farmyard fugitives but people on the watchlist who happen look like plenty of other people. While scanning the crowds at Welsh rugby matches, the NeoFace system spotted one woman on the South Wales police watch list 10 times. None of them were her.</p> <h2><strong>Who has the technology?</strong></h2> <p>Tech firms around the world are developing facial recognition but the US, Russia, China, Japan, Israel and Europe lead the way. Some nations have embraced the technology more readily than others.</p> <p>China has millions of cameras connected to facial recognition software and Russia has declared hopes to expand its own surveillance networks. In Europe, as elsewhere, facial recognition has found its way into shops to spot thieves and into businesses to monitor staff and visitors, but live face recognition in public spaces is still mostly at trial stage.</p> <p>In the US, the police typically use facial recognition to search CCTV footage for suspects rather than scanning live crowds. But it is becoming more pervasive. A 2016 report from Georgetown Law\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology found that half of all Americans are in police facial recognition databases, meaning that algorithms pick suspects from virtual line-ups of 117 million mostly law-abiding citizens.</p> <h2><strong>What does the law say on it?</strong></h2> <p>Not much. In Britain there is no law that gives the police the power to use facial recognition and no government policy on its use. This has led to what Paul Wiles, the Biometrics commissioner, calls a chaotic situation with the police deciding for themselves where and when it is appropriate to use facial recognition and what happens to the images the cameras capture.</p> <p>The campaign group, Liberty, has called for a complete ban on live facial recognition systems in public spaces, arguing that it destroys privacy and forces people to change their behaviour. The group has brought a judicial review against South Wales police over its use of the technology. Similar concerns were raised by the University of Essex in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/03/police-face-calls-to-end-use-of-facial-recognition-software\">an independent review</a> of the Metropolitan police force\u2019s use of facial recognition. It found that people were wrongly stopped, and warned of \u201csurveillance creep\u201d where the technology ends up being used to track people who are not wanted by the courts. Live facial recognition, the report concluded, was likely to fall foul of human rights law.</p> <p>Another area of contention is watchlists. Despite a 2012 high court ruling that retaining images of innocent people was unlawful, the police have steadily built up a custody database of 20 million people, many of whom have never been convicted of a crime. Nonetheless, images from the database, and others scraped from social media, are used to create watchlists for use in facial recognition systems.

      "bodyText": "What is facial recognition? Facial recognition technology has spread prodigiously. It\u2019s there on Facebook, tagging photos from the class reunion, your cousin\u2019s wedding and the office summer party. Google, Microsoft, Apple and others have built it into apps to compile albums of people who hang out together. It verifies who you are at airports and is the latest biometric to unlock your mobile phone where facial recognition apps abound. Need to confirm your identity for a \u00a31,000 bank transfer? Just look into the camera. New applications crop up all the time. Want to know who\u2019s at the door? A video doorbell with facial recognition will tell you, provided you\u2019ve uploaded a photo of the person\u2019s face. Other systems are used to spot missing persons and catch slackers who lie about the hours they spend in the office. Advertisers, of course, are in on the act. Thanks to facial recognition, billboards can now serve up ads based on an estimate of your sex, age and mood. That sounds quite Big Brother. Is it a surveillance tool? Sometimes, yes. China uses facial recognition for racial profiling and its tracking and control of the Uighur muslims has been roundly condemned as a shameful first for a government.Its cameras also spot and fine jaywalkers, verify students at school gates, and monitor their expressions in lessons to ensure they are paying attention. Russia has embraced the technology too. In Moscow, video cameras scan the streets for \u201cpeople of interest\u201d and plans have been mooted to equip the police with glasses that work the same way. There have been reports that Israel is using facial recognition for covert tracking of Palestinians deep inside the West Bank. Meanwhile in Britain, the Metropolitan and South Wales police forces have trialled facial recognition to find people in football and rugby crowds, on city streets, and at commemorations and music festivals. Taylor Swift even installed the tech at a gig in California to weed out stalkers. Shops are increasingly installing the technology to deter and catch thieves. Next year, it will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo. How did it get everywhere? Advances in three technical fields have played a major part: big data, deep convolutional neural networks and powerful graphics processing units or GPUs. Thanks to Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, Google and others, the internet holds billions of photos of people\u2019s faces which have been scraped together into massive image datasets. They are used to train deep neural networks, a mainstay of modern artificial intelligence, to detect and recognise faces. The computational grunt work is often done on GPUs, the superfast chips that are dedicated to graphics processing. But there is more to it than flashy new technology. Over the past decade in particular, facial recognition systems have been deployed all over the place, and the data gathered from them has helped companies hone their technology. How does it work? First off, the computer has to learn what a face is. This can be done by training an algorithm, usually a deep neural network, on a vast number of photos that have faces in known positions. Each time the algorithm is presented with an image, it estimates where the face is. The network will be rubbish at first, like a drunk playing pin the tail on the donkey. But if this is done multiple times, the algorithm improves and eventually masters the art of spotting a face. This is the face detection step. Next up is the recognition part. This is done in various ways, but it\u2019s common to use a second neural network. It is fed a series of face pictures and learns \u2013 over many rounds \u2013 how best to tell one from another. Some algorithms explicitly map the face, measuring the distances between the eyes, nose and mouth and so on. Others map the face using more abstract features. Either way, the network outputs a vector for each face \u2013 a string of numbers that uniquely identifies the person among all the others in the training set. In live deployments, the software goes to work on video footage in real time. The computer scans frames of video usually captured at crowd pinch points, such as entrances to football stadiums. It first detects the faces in a frame, then churns out vectors for each one. The face vectors are then checked against those for people on a watchlist. Any matches that clear a preset threshold are then ranked and displayed. In the British police trials a typical threshold for a match was 60%, but the bar can be set higher to reduce false positives. It\u2019s not the only way the police use facial recognition. If a suspect has been picked up, officers can upload their mugshot and search CCTV footage to potentially trace the suspect\u2019s movements back to the scene of a crime. How accurate is it? The best systems are impressive. Independent tests by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist) found that between 2014 and 2018 facial recognition systems got 20 times better at finding a match in a database of 12m portrait photos. The failure rate fell from 4% to 0.2% over the period, a massive gain in accuracy that was largely down to deep neural networks. Nist says the networks have driven \u201can industrial revolution\u201d in facial recognition. But such great performance depends on ideal conditions: where a crisp and clear mugshot of an unknown person is checked against a database of other high quality photos. In the real world, images can be blurred or poorly lit, people look away from the camera, or may have a scarf over their face, or be much older than in their reference photo. All tend to reduce the accuracy. The technology has a terrible time with twins, the Nist tests found, with even the best algorithms muddling them up. What about bias? Bias has long plagued facial recognition algorithms. The problem comes about when neural networks are trained on different numbers of faces from different groups of people. So if a system is trained on a million white male faces, but fewer women and people of colour, it will be less accurate for the latter groups. Less accuracy means more misidentifications and potentially more people being wrongly stopped and questioned. Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) found that Amazon\u2019s Rekognition software wrongly identified 28 members of Congress as people who had previously been arrested. It disproportionately misidentified African-Americans and Latinos. Amazon said the ACLU had used the wrong settings. Police trials have highlighted further shortcomings of facial recognition. A Cardiff University review of the South Wales trials found that the force\u2019s NEC NeoFace system froze, lagged and crashed when the screen was full of people and performed worse on gloomy days and in the late afternoon because the cameras ramped up their light sensitivity, making footage more \u201cnoisy\u201d. During 55 hours of deployment the system flagged up 2,900 potential matches of which 2,755 were false positives. The police made 18 arrests using the system, but the Cardiff report does not state whether any of the individuals were charged. The Welsh trial highlighted another challenge for facial recognition: lambs. Not farmyard fugitives but people on the watchlist who happen look like plenty of other people. While scanning the crowds at Welsh rugby matches, the NeoFace system spotted one woman on the South Wales police watch list 10 times. None of them were her. Who has the technology? Tech firms around the world are developing facial recognition but the US, Russia, China, Japan, Israel and Europe lead the way. Some nations have embraced the technology more readily than others. China has millions of cameras connected to facial recognition software and Russia has declared hopes to expand its own surveillance networks. In Europe, as elsewhere, facial recognition has found its way into shops to spot thieves and into businesses to monitor staff and visitors, but live face recognition in public spaces is still mostly at trial stage. In the US, the police typically use facial recognition to search CCTV footage for suspects rather than scanning live crowds. But it is becoming more pervasive. A 2016 report from Georgetown Law\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology found that half of all Americans are in police facial recognition databases, meaning that algorithms pick suspects from virtual line-ups of 117 million mostly law-abiding citizens. What does the law say on it? Not much. In Britain there is no law that gives the police the power to use facial recognition and no government policy on its use. This has led to what Paul Wiles, the Biometrics commissioner, calls a chaotic situation with the police deciding for themselves where and when it is appropriate to use facial recognition and what happens to the images the cameras capture. The campaign group, Liberty, has called for a complete ban on live facial recognition systems in public spaces, arguing that it destroys privacy and forces people to change their behaviour. The group has brought a judicial review against South Wales police over its use of the technology. Similar concerns were raised by the University of Essex in an independent review of the Metropolitan police force\u2019s use of facial recognition. It found that people were wrongly stopped, and warned of \u201csurveillance creep\u201d where the technology ends up being used to track people who are not wanted by the courts. Live facial recognition, the report concluded, was likely to fall foul of human rights law. Another area of contention is watchlists. Despite a 2012 high court ruling that retaining images of innocent people was unlawful, the police have steadily built up a custody database of 20 million people, many of whom have never been convicted of a crime. Nonetheless, images from the database, and others scraped from social media, are used to create watchlists for use in facial recognition systems. In the private sector, the situation is even murkier, with shops and businesses deciding who goes on secret watchlists, and sharing images with other firms. In the US the situation is not much better. Only five states have laws that touch on the use of facial recognition by law enforcement. The patchwork of laws means that while the Seattle police force and San Francisco city have banned live facial recognition, the sheriff\u2019s office in Maricopa County, Arizona, uploaded the photo and driver\u2019s licence of every resident in Honduras to its facial recognition watchlist. What about other biometrics While facial recognition technology has drawn huge attention, the police and other organisations are looking carefully at new biometrics, beyond fingerprints and DNA, that uniquely identify people. Skin texture analysis is said to overcome problems with facial recognition caused by different expressions and partially covered faces by analysing the distance between skin pores. It has not been tested much, but developers claim it could be good enough to distinguish between twins. Another biometric that interests the police, because it can be done at a distance without a person\u2019s cooperation, is gait analysis. As the name suggests, the algorithms identify people by the unique style of their stride, reflecting differences in anatomy, genetics, social background, habits and personality. With vein recognition, optical scanners are used to map blood vessels in the hand, finger or eye. Because our veins are buried beneath the skin, the scanners are considered hard to fool. Fujitsu\u2019s PalmSecure system uses vein maps to monitor the to and fro of employees at various businesses. Speaker recognition is already used by banks and the HMRC to confirm people\u2019s identities and its use is spreading.

      "body": "<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/24/topless-sunbathing-falls-vogue-among-french-women/\" title=\"\">a survey of 5,000 women</a> by the French Institute for Public Opinion, the number who regularly sunbathe topless has fallen sharply over the past three years, from 29% to 19%. Digging into the figures, it emerges that the #MeToo movement has been an influence, with women between 18 and 25 citing harassment and ogling. No doubt the fear of unwanted photographs ending up on the internet also plays a part in persuading young women to keep their bikini tops on when they go to the beach.</p> <p>It\u2019s all a little bit sad. Since Brigitte Bardot became famed for it on Riviera beaches in the 1960s, topless sunbathing on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur has occupied a rather romantic place in the Anglo-Saxon cultural mindset, tinged with nostalgia for the iconography of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/07/sex-revolution-my-youth-wasnt-great-maybe-celibacy-sign-progress\" title=\"\">sexual liberation movement</a>. For me and other women growing up in a culture of British discomfort with all things bodily, these confident French women in Cannes or St Tropez seemed glamorous and worldly.</p> <p>A teenage obsession with French cinema helped me to discover the work of Fran\u00e7ois Ozon; in <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2003/07/swimming-pool-gobs-of-nudity-no-point.html\" title=\"\">Swimming Pool</a>, Ludivine Sagnier is famously topless or naked for more than half the film. At the time I treated such nudity with deference: it was culture, it bore no relation to the tabloid posing of glamour models. It was, I thought, cool.</p> <p>But times have changed: the porn industry, rampant in the digital age, has seen female objectification ratcheted up to such a degree that removing your bikini top to avoid tan lines on a public beach has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/26/revenge-porn-and-cyber-flashing-laws-go-under-review\" title=\"\">come to seem </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/26/revenge-porn-and-cyber-flashing-laws-go-under-review\" title=\"\">risky</a> for more and more younger women.</p> <p>I was in my early 20s when I first sunbathed topless. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the feeling of sun on your tits,\u201d a Polish friend said as she stripped off on a beach in Sardinia, unfazed by the company of guys we had only just met. I joined her. A lack of typically English hang-ups probably played a part in her confidence; the existence of breasts were a simple unremarkable fact to her.

      "bodyText": "According to a survey of 5,000 women by the French Institute for Public Opinion, the number who regularly sunbathe topless has fallen sharply over the past three years, from 29% to 19%. Digging into the figures, it emerges that the #MeToo movement has been an influence, with women between 18 and 25 citing harassment and ogling. No doubt the fear of unwanted photographs ending up on the internet also plays a part in persuading young women to keep their bikini tops on when they go to the beach. It\u2019s all a little bit sad. Since Brigitte Bardot became famed for it on Riviera beaches in the 1960s, topless sunbathing on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur has occupied a rather romantic place in the Anglo-Saxon cultural mindset, tinged with nostalgia for the iconography of the sexual liberation movement. For me and other women growing up in a culture of British discomfort with all things bodily, these confident French women in Cannes or St Tropez seemed glamorous and worldly. A teenage obsession with French cinema helped me to discover the work of Fran\u00e7ois Ozon; in Swimming Pool, Ludivine Sagnier is famously topless or naked for more than half the film. At the time I treated such nudity with deference: it was culture, it bore no relation to the tabloid posing of glamour models. It was, I thought, cool. But times have changed: the porn industry, rampant in the digital age, has seen female objectification ratcheted up to such a degree that removing your bikini top to avoid tan lines on a public beach has come to seem risky for more and more younger women. I was in my early 20s when I first sunbathed topless. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the feeling of sun on your tits,\u201d a Polish friend said as she stripped off on a beach in Sardinia, unfazed by the company of guys we had only just met. I joined her. A lack of typically English hang-ups probably played a part in her confidence; the existence of breasts were a simple unremarkable fact to her. She wasn\u2019t weighed down by cultural and sexist baggage. In that she shares her attitude with members of the Swedish feminist organisation Bara Br\u00f6st, who asked, eminently reasonably, why women should be forced to cover up in public pools when men need not (they successfully campaigned to change the rules in Malmo in 2009). After all, the chair of the city\u2019s sports and recreation committee wryly noted, \u201cmany men have larger breasts than women\u201d. More recently, women in Munich demanded \u201ctopfreedom\u201d \u2013 as the cultural and political movement is called \u2013 during the recent heatwave after they were asked to cover up. Their request has been granted: swimwear now must only \u201ccompletely cover the primary reproductive organs\u201d. Since that first experience in Sardinia in my early 20s, I have sunbathed topless in Barcelona and the Cyclades, southern Italy and even Cannes (it is true that it seemed to be mostly older women doing it on the French Riviera). Crucially, I have always been accompanied, often by my husband, so have felt more protected from harassment. The place my friends and I indulge most frequently is the Ladies\u2019 Pond on Hampstead Heath, where on sunny days you\u2019ll find the attractive pondside meadow crowded with women of all ages and demographics. I\u2019ve often thought that, were I an impressionist artist, this is the scene that I would paint.

I don\u2019t want to beg nobody, but level the playing field so I can make it for myself.\u201d The city\u2019s financially struggling school district spent nearly two decades under state control, and recently had to cut off drinking water in many buildings after finding it contaminated with lead. Corporate donations funded the fix. The district\u2019s struggles not only highlights problems with school funding but with segregation: \u201cWe have schools that are more segregated than when my mother went to school there. At least there were some white kids when she went,\u201d said Donna Givens, CEO of the Eastside Community Network. Several voters pointed to Bernie Sanders\u2019 public school proposal as the type of plan needed in Detroit. It would pump federal money into public districts and double starting teacher salaries. Others raised concerns over the loss of affordable and public housing, including Detroit People Platform\u2019s Linda Campbell, who said research shows some Detroiters are spending 60% of their income on rent. \u201cYet we\u2019re investing hundreds of millions of dollars on real estate developments that include the build out of luxury housing that most families can\u2019t afford,\u201d she said. Among the housing proposals that caught Detroiters\u2019 attention is Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s American Housing and Economic Mobility Act that would put $450bn to help communities of colorharmed by deliberate segregation, and fund a massive subsidized housing expansion. Senator Kamala Harris recently rolled out a similar plan meant to boost black home ownership. As the city deals with the nation\u2019s second-highest violent crime rate, a strained relationship exists between black residents and the police. Hebron praised senator Cory Booker\u2019s criminal justice reform proposals, which include clemency for marijuana offenders and a \u201cSecond Look\u201d program to re-evaluate the sentences of those over 50 years old with more than 10 years in jail While some have expressed reservations about Harris\u2019s tenure as a prosecutor for which she has been criticized as being too hard on communities of color, others, like Hebron and Roland Leggett, who is part of the Michigan Democratic Party\u2019s LGBT and Allies Caucus, see her as a reformer: \u201cShe pushes back against the injustices that have happened in the past,\u201d Leggett said. While no voter the Guardian spoke to said they had settled on a candidate, one name came up nearly across the board \u2013 Warren. Attorney Robert Burton-Harris said Warren and Sanders are offering \u201cideas that are big but feasible, and more than lip service\u201d. \u201cYou can say \u2018Oh, we need to change the criminal justice system.\u2019 That could mean anything, but they have specific ideas and are offering specific solutions,\u201d said Burton-Harris. \u201cIf you live in Detroit, you can see the problems they\u2019re identifying and how their proposed fixes could work.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An important LS Lowry painting which was commissioned to promote Britain\u2019s second world war effort on the home front is to return to its home city. The 1943 painting Going To Work is classic Lowry, showing a mass of workers trudging through a white industrial haze to the Mather &amp; Platt engineering works in Newton Heath, Manchester. It was commissioned by the War Artists Advisory Committee and is the only Lowry painting in the collection of the Imperial War Museum. But it has never been on permanent display in the London museum or on any display at the Manchester outpost, IWM North, which opened in 2002. That is something of a \u201ccrazy\u201d oversight, IWM curator Claire Brenard acknowledged given how important Lowry is to Manchester and Salford. From Monday it goes on permanent display at IWN North. \u201cIt just seems the ideal place to hang it,\u201d said Brenard. \u201cIt is incredibly exciting that it will finally be going on permanent display in its home city.\u201d Lowry was commissioned by the committee to depict a northern industrial scene, showing the efforts of men and women working in factories on the home front. The Mather &amp; Platt factory produced battery pumps for all types of industry. It was taken over by the government during the war and manufactured munitions and pumps for the war effort and equipment which was sent for use on the eastern front. Lowry, who volunteered as a firewatcher on the roof of Lewis\u2019s department store during the Blitz, was paid 25 guineas for the commission and completed the work in three months. The War Artists Advisory Committee was set up by Kenneth Clark, director of the National Gallery, and collected around 6,000 art works through commissions, purchases and donations. It would later buy a second Lowry, a painting of the ruins of St Augustine\u2019s church, which is allocated to Manchester Art Gallery. Ahead of its display in Manchester, Going To Work has been conserved, including the removal of varnish which must have been added some time after its acquisition as Lowry did not varnish his paintings. Brenard said the varnish affected the colour balancing of the artwork, adding an unintended hint of yellow. The display is part of a rehang of war-related art at IWM North. As well as Lowry there will be works including Building Flying-Boats by Flora Lion, who painted northern factory scenes during the first world war; and \u2018The \u2018L\u2019 Press.

He added: \u201cThe re-emergence of jazz comes as a natural reaction to rampant micro music \u2026 when you go to watch a video on YouTube there is another 30-second video with another 30 seconds of music on it \u2026 but that means that music is on the same way that the lights are on \u2026 The natural reaction to that is for people to forge a relationship to their music, and jazz is a great place to start as you can\u2019t quickly process it.\u201d</p> <p>Peterson said Jazz re:freshed, a weekly live residency in west London, has provided a space for musicians to play and to build a scene. \u201cJazz is about finding places to play regularly and constantly \u2026 The reason Britain is good is at the moment we are going through a period where lots of people are coming through and sound great is because they are playing a lot and creating their own spaces to do that. They are setting up their own record labels and putting on their own nights. They are taking a DIY approach.\u201d </p>",

Deezer\u2019s Chill Jazz playlist has had a 555% increase in streams in the UK in the last 12 months. The jazz renaissance is being reflected in festivals and ticket sales, with British jazz featuring heavily in this year\u2019s Glastonbury line-up. Notable acts included Sons of Kemet and The Comet is Coming. A number of new jazz festivals have also appeared this year, such as DJ Gilles Peterson\u2019s We Out Here festival in Huntingdon, taking place in August. Peterson said that people\u2019s tastes have become more sophisticated, which is why jazz is gaining popularity, particularly among younger audiences. \u201cIf you\u2019re 21 now, you can get all kinds of music much faster. You can stream it or listen to it via YouTube \u2026 My generation had to buy the records and that took a while to get to a certain point \u2026 so inevitably people get to jazz as it is the holy grail when it comes to music.\u201d Archie Tulk, 16, said: \u201cJazz is so much more accessible. It is not just going to a record shop, it\u2019s there online for you to listen.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s really popular now because there are so many great things for young musicians all over the country, such as [development organisations] Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors in London and Jazzlines in Birmingham. At the moment there is really great scene in London, where lots of jazz musicians are younger.\u201d US musician Miles Mosley, who is part of the West Coast Get Down with Kamasi Washington, said there was a resurgence in other parts of the world as well as the UK. \u201cEveryone wants to return it to what it felt like in the whisky hothouse days, but our version of it.\u201d Mosley\u2019s first single, Abraham, from his album Uprising was named one of NPR\u2019s top 100 songs of 2016. He added: \u201cThe re-emergence of jazz comes as a natural reaction to rampant micro music \u2026 when you go to watch a video on YouTube there is another 30-second video with another 30 seconds of music on it \u2026 but that means that music is on the same way that the lights are on \u2026 The natural reaction to that is for people to forge a relationship to their music, and jazz is a great place to start as you can\u2019t quickly process it.\u201d Peterson said Jazz re:freshed, a weekly live residency in west London, has provided a space for musicians to play and to build a scene. \u201cJazz is about finding places to play regularly and constantly \u2026 The reason Britain is good is at the moment we are going through a period where lots of people are coming through and sound great is because they are playing a lot and creating their own spaces to do that. They are setting up their own record labels and putting on their own nights. They are taking a DIY approach.\u201d",

It was unclear whether the tigers had been killed in captivity or shot in the wild, though authorities believe they were smuggled in to the country to sell as tiger meat and parts, which in Vietnam are used for jewellery and medicine.</p> <p>While international laws have made it illegal to trade in rhino horns since 1977, the black market trade \u2013 with the animals usually poached in Africa and then smuggled to Asia \u2013 has decimated the population, especially as demand from Vietnam and China has continued to grow. There are now only around 29,000 rhinos left in the world, according to the International Rhino Foundation, and it is estimated three rhinos a day are poached in South Africa alone.</p> <p>However, countries across south-east Asia, who in the past have been notoriously lax about enforcing the law, have collectively begun to crack down. Last week, Singapore authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/23/singapore-seizes-record-haul-of-smuggled-elephant-ivory\">seized a record haul of nearly nine tonnes of contraband tusks</a> from an estimated 300 elephants, worth $12.9m (\u00a310.4m), and 11.9 tonnes of pangolin scales, from 2,000 animals, estimated to be worth about $37m (\u00a330m).</p> <p>Earlier this month, a United Nations report laid bare the vast illegal wildlife network that was operating across southeast Asia.

      "bodyText": "More than 125kg of smuggled rhino horns have been seized in Vietnam in one of the biggest wildlife trafficking cases ever seen in south-east Asia. The horns, which had been smuggled in from the United Arab Emirates on an Etihad airways flight, were found in Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai airport concealed in thick plaster. It took over half a day for the customs teams to break all 55 packages all open. Rhino horns, which when ground to a powder are believed by some Vietnamese to have medicinal qualities to cure everything from cancer to a hangover, are particularly lucrative and can fetch up to $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per kilo. The haul seized at Hanoi airport last week was worth around $7.5m (\u00a36m). The seizure is part of a broader crackdown in Vietnam on the vast multi-million dollar wildlife trafficking network operating in the country, which has become a regional hub for the black market trade of everything from rhino horns and tiger skins and meat to elephant tusks and pangolin scales. Last week the Vietnamese authorities discovered seven frozen tiger cub corpses in the back of a car in Hanoi, which they believe had been smuggled in from Laos. It was unclear whether the tigers had been killed in captivity or shot in the wild, though authorities believe they were smuggled in to the country to sell as tiger meat and parts, which in Vietnam are used for jewellery and medicine. While international laws have made it illegal to trade in rhino horns since 1977, the black market trade \u2013 with the animals usually poached in Africa and then smuggled to Asia \u2013 has decimated the population, especially as demand from Vietnam and China has continued to grow. There are now only around 29,000 rhinos left in the world, according to the International Rhino Foundation, and it is estimated three rhinos a day are poached in South Africa alone. However, countries across south-east Asia, who in the past have been notoriously lax about enforcing the law, have collectively begun to crack down. Last week, Singapore authorities seized a record haul of nearly nine tonnes of contraband tusks from an estimated 300 elephants, worth $12.9m (\u00a310.4m), and 11.9 tonnes of pangolin scales, from 2,000 animals, estimated to be worth about $37m (\u00a330m). Earlier this month, a United Nations report laid bare the vast illegal wildlife network that was operating across southeast Asia. The report singled out Laos in particular as \u201ca major global hub for the trafficking of high value and highly threatened species into other Asian markets\u201d adding that the country had been identified as the world\u2019s fastest growing ivory market.",

She often delayed going until she was very sick. During expert testimony to the coroner in Sydney in March, two nurses said the nature of Williams\u2019 pregnancy and Indigeneity made her a high-risk patient, which meant she should have been seen by a doctor and monitored for longer.

      "body": "<p>How easy is it to go green, to make deliberate, eco-friendly choices when you\u2019re barely getting by? Can you be green and poor, as I am?</p> <p>This is the question I have been pondering as politicians and corporations have placed the burden of environmental responsibility on the consumer: stop using plastic straws, carry reusable shopping bags, recycle everything.</p> <p>I live in an environmentally conscious place: a rural town with thriving local food businesses, a farmers\u2019 market and many organic farms. But it\u2019s also a small town in central Appalachia, in the poorest county in my state: Ohio. Many people here go hungry. They can\u2019t afford food, let alone organic food. A gas station is the closest source of \u201cgroceries\u201d for some people without cars. You can\u2019t walk everywhere if you live in the country.</p> <p>For a week, I kept a diary with some of the choices I made toward being green.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/05/americas-unequal-future/embed.html\" data-alt=\"ehrp\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/05/americas-unequal-future/embed.html\">ehrp</a> </figure>  <h2>Monday</h2> <p>I make my son\u2019s lunch for camp. I got rid of most plastic in the kitchen several years ago \u2013 I don\u2019t buy disposable plastic bags, plastic wrap or plastic storage containers \u2013 but reusable cloth bags don\u2019t hold much, and most don\u2019t keep food from going stale, even for a few hours. There\u2019s mold spotted on one of the cloth bags I take out of the drawer, even though I wash, bleach and dry them. Any disposable plastic bags I have \u2013 because my mom sends snacks in them for her grandson, for example \u2013 I wash and carefully dry.</p> <p>I bought my parents beeswax wrap, which I love: reusable, washable food wrap that molds around leftover food, using the heat of your hands, and recently my mom purchased paper and aluminum drinking straws. But it\u2019s been a bit of a struggle to persuade the older members of family to make green choices: it\u2019s new to them, and it seems like extra work, because it often is.</p> <p>My son, a rising third-grader, told me that his school can recycle cans only if the cans are totally empty. But there\u2019s no place or opportunity to dump the liquid in the cafeteria, and he doesn\u2019t have enough time in his 15- to 20-minute lunch period to drink a full can of seltzer or juice without chugging it and getting a stomachache. This was a source of anxiety for him, so I stopped packing cans.</p> <p>I feel that most parents are trying to do their best, despite our often-difficult circumstances in this region, but it\u2019s hard to balance children\u2019s needs, finances and eco-consciousness.</p> <p>It\u2019s hot this summer, usually intense and early, even for swampy Appalachia. Camp is just a 10-minute drive away, but we couldn\u2019t walk it in this heat and with an eight-year-old who is already not thrilled about going to camp so his single mother can work. The rain cools things off enough to open the windows.</p> <p><em>Today\u2019s expenses: </em><em>beeswax </em><em>wrap, $18.99 for </em><em> three wraps</em></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b49a85cbd4488baa4c6b31fa7eee68ffb042ff72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b49a85cbd4488baa4c6b31fa7eee68ffb042ff72/391_330_6690_4853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration for a piece about being green and poor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"725\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So many of my decisions are made by time. There\u2019s a bus station by my house, but the bus comes irregularly, and I only have so long before my son returns from his second day of camp, hungry and wanting dinner. I drive 10 minutes to the small Aldi.</p> <p>Shopping at a discount grocery like Aldi makes it difficult to meal prep because you can\u2019t really plan on what\u2019s going to be there. But when I was laid off from my full-time job in March, I swore I would primarily shop there, or a similarly priced store. Doing so has cut my grocery bill by at least $40 a week. I haven\u2019t been able to find full-time work yet, and I get by with a lot of freelance writing and editing, which means I need to keep my grocery bill low.</p> <p>But Aldi doesn\u2019t have everything I need, like breakfast burritos and tofu for my mostly vegetarian kid, so I have to hit Kroger, too. Fortunately it\u2019s on the way back home. I\u2019m not wasting gas, only time, but I do spend a lot of money for just a few items at Kroger: the eco-friendly dish soap that is not available at the discount store, the recycled paper towels.</p> <p>I spend $50 at Aldi for the bulk of our meals for the week. And I spend $59 at Kroger for just \u2026 things. I\u2019d like to buy local meat \u2013 I feel it tastes better, has fewer hormones, and I like supporting local farmers \u2013 but to do so, I would have to go to yet <em>anothe</em>r grocery store, this one clear across town. This third, smaller store has issues with shelf stability: items don\u2019t sell quickly enough not to go bad sometimes.</p> <p>Often, I shop at the health food store. It\u2019s expensive but locally-owned, and along with herbs and vitamins, they have organic food, frozen meat and vegetarian food. My son and I can walk there, and usually do. Just a few months ago, another, much bigger health and organic food store opened, which is even closer to our house. I\u2019ve only been in the new store once. It looks like a mini Whole Foods and is priced as such. What this community needs isn\u2019t another pricey organic food store; I worry it could put the older, more established local health food store out of business, and it still doesn\u2019t bring affordable, fresh produce to the people who need it most.</p> <p>I bring my own reusable bags to Aldi, which is a requirement and it helps \u2013 if you have to buy or bring shopping bags every time, you will remember to bring them. And I use another of my own bags at Kroger. After unpacking groceries, I return the bags to my car and keep them there.</p> <p><em>Today\u2019s expenses: $59.28 at Kroger for 11 items,</em><em> $50.06 at Aldi for 21 items</em></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>My son and I live alone in an old house, over a hundred years old, which I rent. As a renter, there isn\u2019t a lot you can do. My house has new windows on the top story, but the original ones on the bottom, most of which don\u2019t open. In the winter, I seal the windows to keep in heat, and seal the drafty kitchen door, closing it off for the season. I change the furnace filter regularly and have blackout drapes on many of the windows, which can help keep the house warm or cool.</p> <p>But in the summer, like in many old houses, the downstairs is OK and the upstairs sweltering, too hot to sleep. I have two window air-conditioning units, given to me used. I feel terrible about running them, but am forced to sometimes to escape the high humidity, and 90-plus degree heat we have had this spring and summer.</p> <p>One of my neighbors has a fantastic, almost full-roof display of solar panels, but she owns her home. I can see her panels glinting in the sun from my porch.</p> <p><em>Today\u2019s expenses: </em><em>blackout curtains, $34.95 for </em><em>two; </em><em>furnace </em><em>filter, $36 for </em><em>two</em></p> <h2>Thursday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c5d452e5a6de40b980e94472080d7475a765628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c5d452e5a6de40b980e94472080d7475a765628/453_231_6482_5042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration for a piece about being green and poor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"778\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am someone who was raised in the country, and while I don\u2019t think I ever really made it into the middle class as an adult, my circumstances certainly lessened when I became a single mother, then lessened again when I was laid off. For me, having a dishwasher would be a marker of success. I\u2019m not there yet.</p> <p>I have thought about purchasing a standalone dishwasher, but our older kitchen is extremely small. I don\u2019t have the counter space for a counter dishwasher. So, even though I have read a dishwasher can actually <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/11/24/564055953/to-save-water-should-you-wash-your-hands-of-hand-washing-dishes\">use less water</a>, I have to wash dishes by hand.</p> <p>I wash all of our clothes in cold water in the washing machine. I don\u2019t wash my own shirts or jeans every time I wear them, both to conserve water and electricity and to extend the longevity of clothes. But my son\u2019s clothes, stained with mud, grass and paint, I have to wash often.</p> <p>I hang most of our wet clothes to dry, which is another time-suck and one of my least favorite chores, but prevents the energy usage of the dryer and keeps some shirts from shrinking.</p> <p><em>Today\u2019s expenses: </em><em>hand washing </em><em>dishes: about 50 cents </em><em> a batch;</em><em> </em><em>washing clothes in cold water: about $1.50 a load</em></p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>My son and I are traveling this weekend: flying, which is not an environmentally conscious thing to do. We don\u2019t travel often, but this is a special, long-planned trip to visit family in Colorado, way too far to drive with a small child and my 18-year-old Honda. I would love to replace my car. I know a new model would be more gas efficient, but it\u2019s not possible for me right now financially. A hybrid, or any new or used car, is simply out of my reach.</p> <p>One of the impacts of our current eco-consciousness is some people feeling bad for decisions largely out of their control \u2013 and many people <em>not</em> feeling bad for actions they <em>can</em> control. I feel guilty for flying to see loved ones. Do executives at Coca-Cola feel guilty for their <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/worst-plastic-polluting-companies-2611144880.html\">massive plastic pollution</a>?</p> <p>Somehow I doubt it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/23/fairtrade-ethical-certification-supermarkets-sainsburys\">Is fair trade finished?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The inventor of Keurig K-Cups, a source of mounting plastic pollution, did publicly express <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/the-abominable-k-cup-coffee-pod-environment-problem/386501/\">remorse for his invention</a>. I was gifted a Keurig coffee maker, but used the refillable attachment, putting in my own ground coffee rather than the plastic cups. When that coffee maker broke, I started using a simple French press.</p> <p>You can purchase carbon offsets to try to mitigate some of the environmental damage done by flying. The idea is to invest in green options, like wind farms. This is not something I have done before, and I have to admit, it\u2019s a little overwhelming and confusing, especially as many <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/airline-emissions-carbon-offsets-travel/\">carbon offset companies work directly</a> with airlines and other corporations now.</p> <p>We\u2019re taking a direct flight to Denver, which helps cut down on more unnecessary travel pollution, and we carpool to the airport. I bring empty reusable water bottles for myself and my son, and fill them up after security.</p> <p>I\u2019m disappointed to see the recycling and trash cans at my airport look exactly the same: the recycling can is overflowing with trash. Some airlines mention, as the flight attendants collect items after the drink service, that they recycle those cans and little plastic cups. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airlines-cabin-waste/index.html\">But do they</a>?</p> <p><em>Today\u2019s expenses: </em><em>glass French </em><em>press for coffee, $28.00</em></p> <h2>Saturday</h2> <p>I haven\u2019t bought much new clothing for years. Part of that is out of necessity. Not only can I not afford it, I live in an area without many shopping options. We have a mall, but more storefronts are empty than occupied. The closest Target is across state lines. The biggest clothing retailer in my town is Goodwill, and all my friends and I shop there, and at other, local charity-based thrift shops.</p> <p>It\u2019s normal in my town to wear used things \u2013 something I believe should be normalized <em>everywhere</em>: not to be sporting the latest trend, but to be wearing a piece that meant something to someone you know, that has a story or history. For an item to take up space in this rapidly filling world, it should really matter.</p> <p>It\u2019s so typical to wear used clothes where I live that my friends and I hold clothing swap parties, where we bring bags of clothes that don\u2019t fit any more or household items that we no longer need, and shop each others\u2019 closets. Once, it would have mortified me to be out wearing a dress that a friend pointed to and said: <em>that used to be mine.</em> Now it\u2019s a source of pride. Clothing connects us. It\u2019s more than just fast fashion. <em>That shirt brought me luck,</em> someone said when I held up a red T-shirt at a clothing swap. <em>Maybe it will bring you luck too.</em></p> <p>I didn\u2019t buy anything new for my trip to Colorado. My sneakers are several years old. I wash them carefully, and replace the laces. I do have to buy new shoes for my son often, as kids grow quickly. I sometimes buy items from ThredUp, an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/thredup-conscious-commerce-choose-used-capsule-collection\">online resale clothing shop</a>, and I sell clothes to them as well, usually saving up credit for trade so I don\u2019t have to spend a dime.</p> <p>In Colorado, after eating at a restaurant, I feel nervous asking for a box for leftovers, fearing the worst: Styrofoam. But at every restaurant in Colorado that we patronize, the carryout boxes are recycled or recyclable cardboard.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think we talk enough about how the America consumer\u2019s attempts to go green involve so much uncertainty and lack of agency. Starbucks, for example, gives me a plastic fork for a sandwich I order and certainly don\u2019t need a fork to eat with. They don\u2019t ask first if I want a fork, and should. I leave the fork unwrapped and give it back. But will they just throw it away?</p> <p>Small choices like this feel huge \u2013 but many of them aren\u2019t even choices we as individuals can make. I can\u2019t bring my own takeout containers to local restaurants in Ohio \u2013 it\u2019s a health hazard, according to the restaurants. On our Colorado trip, my mom was amazed at a store that sold soap and shampoo by the barrel \u2013 you bring your own containers to fill. There are no stores like that near me.</p> <p>There are no bins or instructions about recycling in the Airbnb we have rented. So we pitch all the empty cans, bottles and cardboard into a couple of grocery bags, and at the end of our trip, trek them back down the mountain to my boyfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s house in the city (sorry, Judy), where they can be recycled.</p> <p><em>Today\u2019s expenses: </em><em>a pair of kids sneakers, used, about $16</em><em> ($35-40 new)</em></p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>A couple of years ago, inspired by several classmates, my son decided he was going to go vegetarian.

      "bodyText": "How easy is it to go green, to make deliberate, eco-friendly choices when you\u2019re barely getting by? Can you be green and poor, as I am? This is the question I have been pondering as politicians and corporations have placed the burden of environmental responsibility on the consumer: stop using plastic straws, carry reusable shopping bags, recycle everything. I live in an environmentally conscious place: a rural town with thriving local food businesses, a farmers\u2019 market and many organic farms. But it\u2019s also a small town in central Appalachia, in the poorest county in my state: Ohio. Many people here go hungry. They can\u2019t afford food, let alone organic food. A gas station is the closest source of \u201cgroceries\u201d for some people without cars. You can\u2019t walk everywhere if you live in the country. For a week, I kept a diary with some of the choices I made toward being green. Monday I make my son\u2019s lunch for camp. I got rid of most plastic in the kitchen several years ago \u2013 I don\u2019t buy disposable plastic bags, plastic wrap or plastic storage containers \u2013 but reusable cloth bags don\u2019t hold much, and most don\u2019t keep food from going stale, even for a few hours. There\u2019s mold spotted on one of the cloth bags I take out of the drawer, even though I wash, bleach and dry them. Any disposable plastic bags I have \u2013 because my mom sends snacks in them for her grandson, for example \u2013 I wash and carefully dry. I bought my parents beeswax wrap, which I love: reusable, washable food wrap that molds around leftover food, using the heat of your hands, and recently my mom purchased paper and aluminum drinking straws. But it\u2019s been a bit of a struggle to persuade the older members of family to make green choices: it\u2019s new to them, and it seems like extra work, because it often is. My son, a rising third-grader, told me that his school can recycle cans only if the cans are totally empty. But there\u2019s no place or opportunity to dump the liquid in the cafeteria, and he doesn\u2019t have enough time in his 15- to 20-minute lunch period to drink a full can of seltzer or juice without chugging it and getting a stomachache. This was a source of anxiety for him, so I stopped packing cans. I feel that most parents are trying to do their best, despite our often-difficult circumstances in this region, but it\u2019s hard to balance children\u2019s needs, finances and eco-consciousness. It\u2019s hot this summer, usually intense and early, even for swampy Appalachia. Camp is just a 10-minute drive away, but we couldn\u2019t walk it in this heat and with an eight-year-old who is already not thrilled about going to camp so his single mother can work. The rain cools things off enough to open the windows. Today\u2019s expenses: beeswax wrap, $18.99 for three wraps Tuesday So many of my decisions are made by time. There\u2019s a bus station by my house, but the bus comes irregularly, and I only have so long before my son returns from his second day of camp, hungry and wanting dinner. I drive 10 minutes to the small Aldi. Shopping at a discount grocery like Aldi makes it difficult to meal prep because you can\u2019t really plan on what\u2019s going to be there. But when I was laid off from my full-time job in March, I swore I would primarily shop there, or a similarly priced store. Doing so has cut my grocery bill by at least $40 a week. I haven\u2019t been able to find full-time work yet, and I get by with a lot of freelance writing and editing, which means I need to keep my grocery bill low. But Aldi doesn\u2019t have everything I need, like breakfast burritos and tofu for my mostly vegetarian kid, so I have to hit Kroger, too. Fortunately it\u2019s on the way back home. I\u2019m not wasting gas, only time, but I do spend a lot of money for just a few items at Kroger: the eco-friendly dish soap that is not available at the discount store, the recycled paper towels. I spend $50 at Aldi for the bulk of our meals for the week. And I spend $59 at Kroger for just \u2026 things. I\u2019d like to buy local meat \u2013 I feel it tastes better, has fewer hormones, and I like supporting local farmers \u2013 but to do so, I would have to go to yet another grocery store, this one clear across town. This third, smaller store has issues with shelf stability: items don\u2019t sell quickly enough not to go bad sometimes. Often, I shop at the health food store. It\u2019s expensive but locally-owned, and along with herbs and vitamins, they have organic food, frozen meat and vegetarian food. My son and I can walk there, and usually do. Just a few months ago, another, much bigger health and organic food store opened, which is even closer to our house. I\u2019ve only been in the new store once. It looks like a mini Whole Foods and is priced as such. What this community needs isn\u2019t another pricey organic food store; I worry it could put the older, more established local health food store out of business, and it still doesn\u2019t bring affordable, fresh produce to the people who need it most. I bring my own reusable bags to Aldi, which is a requirement and it helps \u2013 if you have to buy or bring shopping bags every time, you will remember to bring them. And I use another of my own bags at Kroger. After unpacking groceries, I return the bags to my car and keep them there. Today\u2019s expenses: $59.28 at Kroger for 11 items, $50.06 at Aldi for 21 items Wednesday My son and I live alone in an old house, over a hundred years old, which I rent. As a renter, there isn\u2019t a lot you can do. My house has new windows on the top story, but the original ones on the bottom, most of which don\u2019t open. In the winter, I seal the windows to keep in heat, and seal the drafty kitchen door, closing it off for the season. I change the furnace filter regularly and have blackout drapes on many of the windows, which can help keep the house warm or cool. But in the summer, like in many old houses, the downstairs is OK and the upstairs sweltering, too hot to sleep. I have two window air-conditioning units, given to me used. I feel terrible about running them, but am forced to sometimes to escape the high humidity, and 90-plus degree heat we have had this spring and summer. One of my neighbors has a fantastic, almost full-roof display of solar panels, but she owns her home. I can see her panels glinting in the sun from my porch. Today\u2019s expenses: blackout curtains, $34.95 for two; furnace filter, $36 for two Thursday I am someone who was raised in the country, and while I don\u2019t think I ever really made it into the middle class as an adult, my circumstances certainly lessened when I became a single mother, then lessened again when I was laid off. For me, having a dishwasher would be a marker of success. I\u2019m not there yet. I have thought about purchasing a standalone dishwasher, but our older kitchen is extremely small. I don\u2019t have the counter space for a counter dishwasher. So, even though I have read a dishwasher can actually use less water, I have to wash dishes by hand. I wash all of our clothes in cold water in the washing machine. I don\u2019t wash my own shirts or jeans every time I wear them, both to conserve water and electricity and to extend the longevity of clothes. But my son\u2019s clothes, stained with mud, grass and paint, I have to wash often. I hang most of our wet clothes to dry, which is another time-suck and one of my least favorite chores, but prevents the energy usage of the dryer and keeps some shirts from shrinking. Today\u2019s expenses: hand washing dishes: about 50 cents a batch; washing clothes in cold water: about $1.50 a load Friday My son and I are traveling this weekend: flying, which is not an environmentally conscious thing to do. We don\u2019t travel often, but this is a special, long-planned trip to visit family in Colorado, way too far to drive with a small child and my 18-year-old Honda. I would love to replace my car. I know a new model would be more gas efficient, but it\u2019s not possible for me right now financially. A hybrid, or any new or used car, is simply out of my reach. One of the impacts of our current eco-consciousness is some people feeling bad for decisions largely out of their control \u2013 and many people not feeling bad for actions they can control. I feel guilty for flying to see loved ones. Do executives at Coca-Cola feel guilty for their massive plastic pollution? Somehow I doubt it. The inventor of Keurig K-Cups, a source of mounting plastic pollution, did publicly express remorse for his invention. I was gifted a Keurig coffee maker, but used the refillable attachment, putting in my own ground coffee rather than the plastic cups. When that coffee maker broke, I started using a simple French press. You can purchase carbon offsets to try to mitigate some of the environmental damage done by flying. The idea is to invest in green options, like wind farms. This is not something I have done before, and I have to admit, it\u2019s a little overwhelming and confusing, especially as many carbon offset companies work directly with airlines and other corporations now. We\u2019re taking a direct flight to Denver, which helps cut down on more unnecessary travel pollution, and we carpool to the airport. I bring empty reusable water bottles for myself and my son, and fill them up after security. I\u2019m disappointed to see the recycling and trash cans at my airport look exactly the same: the recycling can is overflowing with trash. Some airlines mention, as the flight attendants collect items after the drink service, that they recycle those cans and little plastic cups. But do they?

      "body": "<p>Countries neighbouring the still rumbling Syrian war are rounding up hundreds of workers and sending many back to volatile parts of the country, raising fears of mass deportations that will imperil large numbers of refugees.</p> <p>Syrians living in Istanbul and Beirut have been targeted by immigration authorities in recent weeks, with more than 1,000 detained in Turkey\u2019s biggest city last weekend and given 30 days to leave.</p> <p>Some refugees described a whirlwind deportation process of being transferred through three detention facilities. Their mobile phones confiscated, they were held incommunicado from families or lawyers and forced to sign papers saying they \u201cvoluntarily\u201d agreed to return to war-ravaged Syria.</p> <p>The scale and speed of the arrests mark a reversal of Turkey\u2019s open-door policy towards Syrian refugees \u2013 a hallmark of the war\u2019s early years during which up to 5 million people crossed the Turkish border.</p> <p>In the Lebanese capital, refugees, many of them undocumented workers, have spoken of being summarily dismissed from their jobs since early July as part of a new government decree, the stated aim of which is to prioritise Lebanese labour over foreign workers. The new law comes amid heightened political rhetoric over the fate of Syrian migrants, with Lebanese allies of the Syrian leader insisting that the war is all but over and the country is safe.</p> <p>While tensions between refugees and host governments have risen in recent years, the current moves pose the most pointed threat yet to more than 5 million Syrians living in Turkey and Lebanon \u2013 two countries that readily took in those fleeing the fighting as the war intensified from 2012.</p> <p>As the fortunes of the anti-Assad opposition have shifted in favour of the Syrian leader and his backers, so too have the politics; Turkey, while remaining a nominal foe of Bashar al-Assad, now approaches the war through more narrow national interests, allying with armed opposition groups where it chooses but no longer pushing for regime change.</p> <p>Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Saad Hariri, a backer of the armed opposition in the early years, has also changed tack and, sparked by politicians whose fortunes are tied to the Assad regime, the country\u2019s political discourse has turned against Syrians.

      "bodyText": "Countries neighbouring the still rumbling Syrian war are rounding up hundreds of workers and sending many back to volatile parts of the country, raising fears of mass deportations that will imperil large numbers of refugees. Syrians living in Istanbul and Beirut have been targeted by immigration authorities in recent weeks, with more than 1,000 detained in Turkey\u2019s biggest city last weekend and given 30 days to leave. Some refugees described a whirlwind deportation process of being transferred through three detention facilities. Their mobile phones confiscated, they were held incommunicado from families or lawyers and forced to sign papers saying they \u201cvoluntarily\u201d agreed to return to war-ravaged Syria. The scale and speed of the arrests mark a reversal of Turkey\u2019s open-door policy towards Syrian refugees \u2013 a hallmark of the war\u2019s early years during which up to 5 million people crossed the Turkish border. In the Lebanese capital, refugees, many of them undocumented workers, have spoken of being summarily dismissed from their jobs since early July as part of a new government decree, the stated aim of which is to prioritise Lebanese labour over foreign workers. The new law comes amid heightened political rhetoric over the fate of Syrian migrants, with Lebanese allies of the Syrian leader insisting that the war is all but over and the country is safe. While tensions between refugees and host governments have risen in recent years, the current moves pose the most pointed threat yet to more than 5 million Syrians living in Turkey and Lebanon \u2013 two countries that readily took in those fleeing the fighting as the war intensified from 2012. As the fortunes of the anti-Assad opposition have shifted in favour of the Syrian leader and his backers, so too have the politics; Turkey, while remaining a nominal foe of Bashar al-Assad, now approaches the war through more narrow national interests, allying with armed opposition groups where it chooses but no longer pushing for regime change. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Saad Hariri, a backer of the armed opposition in the early years, has also changed tack and, sparked by politicians whose fortunes are tied to the Assad regime, the country\u2019s political discourse has turned against Syrians. In Lebanon and Turkey, polling shows sentiment running heavily against Syrian refugees, with a widespread view that undocumented migrants are taking jobs that would otherwise go to locals. The claim by politicians in Lebanon that conditions have stabilised in Syria has been widely contradicted by humanitarian groups, and by the existence of still-raging battlefields in Syria\u2019s north-west, which have been routinely bombarded since the end of April. A Russian and Syrian-led air campaign in that time has killed more than 400 people, including 90 children, monitoring organisations say. In the latest attack, a marketplace in the town of Ariha was bombed on Saturday, killing 11 and wounding more than a dozen others. Lebanon\u2019s labour minister, Camille Abousleiman, said he was \u201csimply applying the law\u201d. \u201cIt is my job to properly regulate the labour market,\u201d he said. \u201cTo encourage Lebanese workers, as the economy isn\u2019t doing so well, and regulate the foreign workers.

Thousands of demonstrators joined aviation workers at the airport for an 11-hour-sit-in on Friday. The former British colony is facing its most serious political crisis since it was returned to Chinese control in 1997. Under the terms of that agreement, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as: \u201cOne country, two systems.\u201d Sunday\u2019s protests marked the eighth consecutive weekend that Hongkongers have taken to the streets in protests that began over an extradition bill that would have allowed wanted suspects to be sent to mainland China. As the police fired continuous rounds of teargas into crowds on Sunday, some protesters fell to ground choking. One group sought refuge in a nearby apartment building when residents opened the gate, ushering them in. Demonstrators collapsed on the stairwell, some of them crying. \u201cEven though the protesters are peaceful, they keep throwing the teargas. I don\u2019t know why they keep throwing,\u201d said Hinton, 16, who had tears in his eyes after being gassed. Police said they used teargas to disperse protesters who were hurling bricks at them but protesters insisted police fired first. \u201cWe are trying to protect our own freedom. We are doing this for this place, our place. I\u2019ll be honest, I did throw things because I\u2019m that angry,\u201d said one protester, Angus, 24. The protesters were then pushed back to smaller roads in Sheung Wan, a normally busy neighbourhood turned into a ghost town after shops closed and residents were warned to stay inside. Tourists and residents ran from the scene, covering their eyes and mouths. Before midnight, the police had surrounded the protesters, shielding themselves with wooden boards and street signs. Teargas was lobbed at the protesters from all directions, shrouding the road and forcing the protesters to enter a mass transit station and leave. Some protesters said the police appeared to escalating their tactics, with officers firing on protesters earlier and more frequently. \u201cI can\u2019t even count how many rounds of teargas they used,\u201d said Roy Chan, 39. In a statement, the government said protesters had pushed a cart of burning cardboard at police, \u201cthreatening the safety of police officers and members of public\u201d. The government said it would \u201ccontinue to give full support to police to strictly enforce the law to stop all violent behaviours\u201d. Police said 49 people had been arrested in relation to Sunday\u2019s protest, for suspected unlawful assembly and possession of offensive weapons. Organisers for Sunday\u2019s event had originally planned to march from central Hong Kong to Sheung Wan to condemn the police for firing teargas and rubber bullets on protesters last weekend. The police did not grant a permit for the march \u2013 the second time authorities have rejected a protest request \u2013 following a ban on the Saturday rally in Yuen Long. Protesters fear authorities will adopt this line more in the future. On Sunday, one of the organisers of the Yuen Long rally, Max Chung, was arrested by police on suspicion of inciting an illegal assembly. Some say the situation risks spiralling out of control as the public doubts the Hong Kong government\u2019s ability to govern and Beijing is likely to pressure Hong Kong authorities to take a harder line on protesters. As protesters continue to clash with police, people have only grown more frustrated, fuelling yet more demonstrations. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of public anger and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to go away soon,\u201d said James Yip, 27, part of the group of protesters leaving Sheung Wan. \u201cI think everyone is exhausted on both side, pro-government and pro-democracy.\u201d Exhaustion among protests appears to have set in as well. Amy Yeung, 26, has been attending as many protests as she can. \u201cI am mentally tired. Watching the news, you cry,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at least standing here, we are giving the message that we are not alone.\u201d On Sunday, protesters said they were more angry than exhausted and would continue. Jonathan, 19, who was resting on a curb away from the frontline in between rounds of teargas, said: \u201cThey see us as a threat because we are having an impact.\u201d Residents have seen Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong grow in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent book sellers have disappeared from the city, to reappear in mainland China facing charges, a point critics of the extradition bill often make. \u201cIt seems to us that this is our last chance. If we don\u2019t do this now, we won\u2019t be able to later,\u201d said Eunice Chan, 55, who grew up in Hong Kong before it was returned to Chinese control in 1997.",

Female homemakers are judged harshly in society if they don\u2019t have children to care for \u2013 it\u2019s assumed they\u2019re cookie-cutter housewives who only occupied themselves with a career until they got married and could be taken care of. A male homemaker with no kids? I can\u2019t even imagine what the world would think of me. Lazy, unmotivated, unambitious, I suppose. It does astound me that I get such fulfilment from househusbandry. Professionally, I once obsessed over reaching career highs, but after a decade in the game, the rat race thing became dull. I was sick of being stressed every day. I hated spending all weekend mowing the lawn and hanging six loads of laundry out to dry. I loathed how much of my brainpower went into petty office politicking. In a 2013 Slate article, childless househusband Finn Boulding wrote: \u201cKids are a get-out-of-jail-free card when it comes to breaking stereotypical gender roles, but without them homemaking is not really seen as an ambitious life calling or even particularly time-consuming.\u201d It\u2019s true to some extent. I do have time to spend 90 minutes in the gym every morning and take the dog hiking several times a week. But I also spend several hours a day scrubbing on my knees, sweeping, mopping and using superglue, sewing needles and a hammer. I will admit I\u2019m not busy in the usual sense of the word, though. I don\u2019t rush from task to task. I can put my full attention into everything home life requires. Busy culture has led to an overworked, overweight, anxious, depressed society. I\u2019m happy to have removed myself from it. That\u2019s not the main reason I love househusbandry. I was happy-ish working 50 hours a week and didn\u2019t have some kind of nervous breakdown where I decided office life just wasn\u2019t for me. Instead, as my spouse rose up the military ranks over the years, it became increasingly obvious that full-time support at home was the best way forward for our happy future. We had the financial means to survive on one salary, so why not? I won\u2019t sit on my death bed thinking, \u201cI wish I\u2019d spent more time in a cubicle.\u201d They won\u2019t say it, but my friends and family look down their noses at me staying home. They think I\u2019m either a kept man or wasting my potential, or both. I hope it\u2019s just their jealousy that my spouse and I have figured out a way to set us up financially so we don\u2019t both need to work. It\u2019s a feminist ideal for couples to have the choice to have one spouse at home. The freedom to do this shouldn\u2019t be contingent on children to care for. In an age where people are professional Call of Duty players and Instagram influencers, it makes little sense to have any biases about homemaking and who is \u201callowed\u201d to do it. If you\u2019ve found a way to survive and be happy in the 21st century, the reality is, you\u2019re doing very well at life. \u2022 Lee Suckling is a writer and military spouse living in Wellington, New Zealand",

Player welfare is a real concern | Sharni Layton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Star players missed out through injury or illness, others turned in sub-par performances or simply looked exhausted on court, matches were scratchy, and a tense exchange between Collingwood coach Rob Wright and Diamonds midcourter Kelsey Browne highlighted the issue of player management in the shadows of such a big tournament.</p> <p>Of the 31 Super Netball athletes who travelled to the World Cup in Liverpool, just 17 managed full 60-minute games at the weekend. Almost all are automatic starters and consistently play out matches. They\u2019re also players fans come to watch. The extra players allowed by the league saw minimal court time, meaning coaches turned to their top lines, despite truncated preparations.</p> <p>One of the league\u2019s biggest names, Adelaide Thunderbirds shooter Maria Folau, who won the World Cup with the Silver Ferns earlier in the week, didn\u2019t play in her side\u2019s 63-57 loss to the Vixens due to illness. She pulled out just hours before the game on Sunday.</p> <p>Her Thunderbirds teammate, English defender Layla Guscoth was missing too \u2013 and will be for the rest of the year \u2013 after sustaining an Achilles injury in Liverpool.</p> <p>Another Roses player, Chelsea Pitman, battled hard for Adelaide, with 30 centre pass receives and 29 feeds, but couldn\u2019t hide her fatigue after nine matches of elite netball in 17 days. Pitman, who played 60 minutes, had two uncharacteristic turnovers and one \u201cbad hands\u201d stat.</p> <p>Vixens coach Simone McKinnis started with her three Diamonds \u2013 shooter Caitlin Thwaites, midcourter Liz Watson and defender Jo Weston \u2013 and only Weston got a break, of about 13 minutes.</p> <p>Thwaites, who was one of the most accurate shooters at the World Cup but got minimal court time, looked spent from early in the match. But she stayed the course, eventually ending up out of position at goal attack and scoring 30 goals from 33 attempts at 91% accuracy. It was a performance Vixens fans will long remember for its sheer intrepidity.</p> <p>With 31 centre pass receives and round-high 43 feeds, Watson didn\u2019t play tired and Weston looked relatively unphased, despite her heavy workload in Liverpool.</p> <p>While she ended up controversially winning the MVP in her side\u2019s 53-49 win over the West Coast Fever, England and Swifts shooter Helen Housby \u2013 who flew directly from the UK to Perth, bypassing her Sydney home so tight was the timeframe \u2013 was below her best, shooting at 79% accuracy. She is usually up around 83%.</p> <p>In the first quarter, Shannon Eagland twice won the ball from Housby, who stepped and only shot two from three attempts; a world away from the star who had 29 from 29 in England\u2019s bronze medal match against South Africa in Liverpool.</p> <p>Before the match Housby posted to Instagram, mocking her own comment about a having a \u201clittle bit of fatigue\u201d, instead characterising her true feelings as \u201cHelp me Sir, I think I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p> <p>Fever\u2019s captain Courtney Bruce seemed to relish playing under Australian umpires again \u2013 in stark comparison to Liverpool, where she was whistled out of several games \u2013 and didn\u2019t show any outward signs of jet lag. She almost single-handedly kept her side in the match with two gains and an intercept.</p> <p>The west Australians\u2019 other star player, Jamaican shooter Jhaniele Fowler, was again a tower of strength, but her accuracy dipped and she finished with 43 from 47 attempts, including three misses in the last, at 91%. While most shooters would take 91%, Fowler usually sits at 95%.</p> <p>In Collingwood\u2019s 63-56 loss to the Giants in Melbourne, England\u2019s Geva Mentor \u2013 who said she felt fine physically, but \u201cdrunk\u201d mentally given the demanding schedule \u2013 had one of her poorest games of the season. At half-time, the usual match-winner didn\u2019t have an intercept or rebound to her name on Diamonds captain Caitlin Bassett.</p> <p>Bassett looked solid, with 35 from 38, at 92% accuracy, and shared some of the best passages to date with her shooting partner, Roses player Jo Harten, who shot 23 from 27 and won MVP after playing three quarters.</p> <p>The biggest talking point out of the Pies\u2019 loss was a spat between Wright and Browne just before half-time which was caught on camera. After asking for \u201csome positives\u201d from her coach, a clearly upset Browne was told by Wright, \u201cI can\u2019t give you a positive when you\u2019re not doing it. How about doing some, because at the moment, to me, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>Following words from Browne not caught by the microphone, Wright added: \u201cA bit less attitude I reckon, I don\u2019t need it. Do your role.\u201d And he benched Browne.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/25/world-cup-winning-nz-netballers-rewarded-with-unprecedented-payment-after-outcry\">World Cup-winning NZ netballers rewarded with unprecedented payment after outcry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Wright was quick to admit in an in-game interview he could have done better, social media lit up with fans who suggested the eccentric coach should take more care with a young player coming off a one-goal World Cup final defeat. It\u2019s hard to argue with such sentiment.</p> <p>In their side\u2019s 66-64 win over the Firebirds, Sunshine Coast Lightning\u2019s World Cup foursome, Kiwi superstar Laura Langman, Australian shooter Steph Wood and South African defenders Karla Pretorius and Phumza Maweni, all played 60 minutes, with Langman, predictably, in the best.</p> <p>Despite scrappy patches, the Lightning got coach Noeline Taurua her second win of the week. A spirited Firebirds outfit was led by Gabi Simpson, who starred in her 100<sup>th </sup>game.</p> <p>The first round back was always going to provide talking points, but it is what happens from hereon in \u2013 not just physically, but psychologically given the strains that are evident on both athletes and teams \u2013 that will define the season and the governing body\u2019s decision to split the season in two.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pressing pause on the world\u2019s best netball league mid-season and re-starting it just six days after the conclusion to the sport\u2019s pinnacle event \u2013 held 17,000km away \u2013 was always going to be problematic. It was inevitable the spectacle would suffer. And now we\u2019re back after an unprecedented five-week hiatus, it\u2019s clear just how much lustre Super Netball has lost because of its World Cup break. The weekend\u2019s round made real many of the concerns raised when Netball Australia last year announced how it would structure the 2019 season, especially around potential player burnout. Star players missed out through injury or illness, others turned in sub-par performances or simply looked exhausted on court, matches were scratchy, and a tense exchange between Collingwood coach Rob Wright and Diamonds midcourter Kelsey Browne highlighted the issue of player management in the shadows of such a big tournament. Of the 31 Super Netball athletes who travelled to the World Cup in Liverpool, just 17 managed full 60-minute games at the weekend. Almost all are automatic starters and consistently play out matches. They\u2019re also players fans come to watch. The extra players allowed by the league saw minimal court time, meaning coaches turned to their top lines, despite truncated preparations. One of the league\u2019s biggest names, Adelaide Thunderbirds shooter Maria Folau, who won the World Cup with the Silver Ferns earlier in the week, didn\u2019t play in her side\u2019s 63-57 loss to the Vixens due to illness. She pulled out just hours before the game on Sunday. Her Thunderbirds teammate, English defender Layla Guscoth was missing too \u2013 and will be for the rest of the year \u2013 after sustaining an Achilles injury in Liverpool. Another Roses player, Chelsea Pitman, battled hard for Adelaide, with 30 centre pass receives and 29 feeds, but couldn\u2019t hide her fatigue after nine matches of elite netball in 17 days. Pitman, who played 60 minutes, had two uncharacteristic turnovers and one \u201cbad hands\u201d stat. Vixens coach Simone McKinnis started with her three Diamonds \u2013 shooter Caitlin Thwaites, midcourter Liz Watson and defender Jo Weston \u2013 and only Weston got a break, of about 13 minutes. Thwaites, who was one of the most accurate shooters at the World Cup but got minimal court time, looked spent from early in the match. But she stayed the course, eventually ending up out of position at goal attack and scoring 30 goals from 33 attempts at 91% accuracy. It was a performance Vixens fans will long remember for its sheer intrepidity. With 31 centre pass receives and round-high 43 feeds, Watson didn\u2019t play tired and Weston looked relatively unphased, despite her heavy workload in Liverpool. While she ended up controversially winning the MVP in her side\u2019s 53-49 win over the West Coast Fever, England and Swifts shooter Helen Housby \u2013 who flew directly from the UK to Perth, bypassing her Sydney home so tight was the timeframe \u2013 was below her best, shooting at 79% accuracy. She is usually up around 83%. In the first quarter, Shannon Eagland twice won the ball from Housby, who stepped and only shot two from three attempts; a world away from the star who had 29 from 29 in England\u2019s bronze medal match against South Africa in Liverpool. Before the match Housby posted to Instagram, mocking her own comment about a having a \u201clittle bit of fatigue\u201d, instead characterising her true feelings as \u201cHelp me Sir, I think I\u2019m dying.\u201d Fever\u2019s captain Courtney Bruce seemed to relish playing under Australian umpires again \u2013 in stark comparison to Liverpool, where she was whistled out of several games \u2013 and didn\u2019t show any outward signs of jet lag. She almost single-handedly kept her side in the match with two gains and an intercept. The west Australians\u2019 other star player, Jamaican shooter Jhaniele Fowler, was again a tower of strength, but her accuracy dipped and she finished with 43 from 47 attempts, including three misses in the last, at 91%. While most shooters would take 91%, Fowler usually sits at 95%. In Collingwood\u2019s 63-56 loss to the Giants in Melbourne, England\u2019s Geva Mentor \u2013 who said she felt fine physically, but \u201cdrunk\u201d mentally given the demanding schedule \u2013 had one of her poorest games of the season. At half-time, the usual match-winner didn\u2019t have an intercept or rebound to her name on Diamonds captain Caitlin Bassett. Bassett looked solid, with 35 from 38, at 92% accuracy, and shared some of the best passages to date with her shooting partner, Roses player Jo Harten, who shot 23 from 27 and won MVP after playing three quarters. The biggest talking point out of the Pies\u2019 loss was a spat between Wright and Browne just before half-time which was caught on camera. After asking for \u201csome positives\u201d from her coach, a clearly upset Browne was told by Wright, \u201cI can\u2019t give you a positive when you\u2019re not doing it. How about doing some, because at the moment, to me, you\u2019re not.\u201d Following words from Browne not caught by the microphone, Wright added: \u201cA bit less attitude I reckon, I don\u2019t need it. Do your role.\u201d And he benched Browne. While Wright was quick to admit in an in-game interview he could have done better, social media lit up with fans who suggested the eccentric coach should take more care with a young player coming off a one-goal World Cup final defeat. It\u2019s hard to argue with such sentiment. In their side\u2019s 66-64 win over the Firebirds, Sunshine Coast Lightning\u2019s World Cup foursome, Kiwi superstar Laura Langman, Australian shooter Steph Wood and South African defenders Karla Pretorius and Phumza Maweni, all played 60 minutes, with Langman, predictably, in the best. Despite scrappy patches, the Lightning got coach Noeline Taurua her second win of the week. A spirited Firebirds outfit was led by Gabi Simpson, who starred in her 100th game. The first round back was always going to provide talking points, but it is what happens from hereon in \u2013 not just physically, but psychologically given the strains that are evident on both athletes and teams \u2013 that will define the season and the governing body\u2019s decision to split the season in two.",

      "bodyText": "Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been hospitalised, with symptoms that one of his doctors said appeared to be \u201cthe result of harmful effects of undefined chemical substances\u201d. Navalny was taken to hospital on Sunday morning from jail, where he was serving a 30-day sentence after being arrested last week for calling people to attend an anti-government protest. The protest went ahead on Saturday, and prompted the most forceful police response to protests in the country for years, with more than 1,300 people detained by officers. People were protesting against the refusal of electoral authorities to register independent candidates for the Moscow city council elections in September. Although there was no sign that his life is in immediate danger, the news about Navalny\u2019s health will cause alarm, in a country where opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was shot dead outside the Kremlin in 2015. On Sunday morning, Navalny\u2019s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said he had suffered a \u201csevere allergic reaction\u201d, and added that he had never complained of allergies before. She said Navalny had suffered \u201csevere swelling of the face and skin redness\u201d. On Sunday afternoon, Navalny associate Leonid Volkov said he was not minded to see foul play in Navalny\u2019s condition, saying he had been held in exactly the same cell last month and also suffered a skin rash, citing poor sanitary conditions in the jail. However later on Sunday, Anastasia Vasilieva, one of Navalny\u2019s doctors, wrote in a Facebook post that she and a colleague had visited Navalny in hospital, and had first been denied access but were eventually able to examine him. An ophthalmologist, who treated Navalny after he was doused with green dye by pro-Kremlin activists in 2017 in an attack that left him temporarily blind in one eye, Vasilieva said it was clear Navalny was not suffering from an allergy but from exposure to toxic substances. \u201cWe cannot exclude toxic damage to the skin by chemicals induced by a \u2018third person\u2019,\u201d she wrote. She called on the hospital administration to immediately allow proper medical care for Navalny. The hospital has not yet made an official statement. Police detained at least 10 of Navalny\u2019s supporters who had gathered outside the hospital late on Sunday evening, according to a correspondent for Russia\u2019s TV Rain. Several other opposition politicians remain in jail, held on the charge of \u201cobstructing the work of the electoral commission\u201d, and police have carried out late-night searches of their homes in recent days. Most of the more than 1,300 protesters detained on Saturday were released without charge, but more than 150 spent the night in police stations and may face court cases this week. An independent monitoring group said at least 25 people sustained injuries at the hands of police. Saturday\u2019s protest came a week after more than 20,000 people rallied in central Moscow to protest against the decision to ban the candidates from standing in September\u2019s local vote, on what the opposition says is the invented pretext that some of the signatures collected to support their candidacies were faked. The turnout shocked authorities, prompting them to arrest Navalny and declare this weekend\u2019s protest illegal. On Saturday morning, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin warned people that they could face arrest if they tried to protest, and riot police had clearly been given orders to move forcefully against the demonstrators. Large areas of the centre were cordoned off, and police used rough tactics and batons to detain protesters despite their action remaining peaceful. Natalia Zviagina, of Amnesty International, said the violent response to the protest was a \u201cnew low\u201d for Russian authorities and called on police to release all of those detained. \u201cNo one should be imprisoned for merely exercising their rights to expression and peaceful assembly,\u201d she said. Opposition leaders have said they will call another protest for this coming Saturday, 3 August, in an attempt to keep up the pressure on authorities. Russian president Vladimir Putin, who on Saturday descended in a miniature submarine to inspect the wreck of a second world war submarine, had not commented on the protests or the arrests as of Sunday. State TV has also largely ignored the unrest, but millions of Russians watched live streams of Saturday\u2019s events on YouTube.",
